Salary $75,000 gross.

My question is this: how are people buying homes? I currently pay $900 in rent for a really nice 2br apartment in a very small town. The average cost for a home you’d feel comfortable living in around here is roughly $250k-$270k. Based on the research I’ve done it seems like interest rates are roughly 7% depending on a few factors. 

Doing basic math, that’s a monthly payment of roughly $1,660, and you’re paying a total cost of $598,000 over the 30y term.

The only reason we even have more hours right now is cuz corporate is sending much more inventory than the store actually needs, and the stock room is overfilled, meaning we need a large stock team working 20 hr weeks.

Having become disabled with a connective tissue disorder at a similar age to when you lost your sight I find immeasurable hope and comfort in the Marvel Netflix show, Daredevil, you consulted on. I have allowed it’s impact, and subsequently yours, to shape and hold value in my life especially in how I view my own strengths and limitations. In 2020 Marvel introduced a fan-made disabled character Charolette Webber AKA Sun-Spider with Into The Spiderverse. She is queer and has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, the first portrayal I have seen of my connective tissue disorder, as well as in combination with my orientation, in mainstream media. I suspect that audiences may have their first learning experience with the condition from this character. As I have encountered many health professionals that have not been made aware of it’s existence despite decades of experience. Although there are a dozen other characters with disabilities or mobility aids, I felt with the resurgence of Daredevil’s popularity due its emotionally provocative accuracy that Sun-Spider was able to be brought into the spotlight were representation is desperately needed. ***Where along your path did you become aware that your impact would have far-reaching implications for a broader perspective of disabled and minority storytelling?***",NoStupidQuestions,1

I'm honestly surprised she stuck around because looking back, my replies were half hearted. And she had this way of smiling and making eye contact that just totally captivated me

Long story short, we exchanged numbers, and we've been vibing for about two weeks now. Here's the thing  - I really want to ask her out, but I'm worried it might mess up our friendship. She mentioned that a friend of hers confessed to her, and things got kinda awkward. Plus, I've been wondering if she's into me the way I am into her.

A lot of those stories seam to center around guests wearing white dresses, and I completely understand why that's a no go. However, I recently came across a story where ab afab NB person who self described as androgynous wore a dark suit including a jacket with a white blouse and getting shit from others for it. I was massively confused, since men wear white shirts at weddings all the time and it's not a big deal.

So I started wondering, how much white do you think is acceptable as a guest? My sister wore a white belt with her dress at my dad's second wedding (she was 20 at the time, so not a little girl) and nobody commented, though she did get approval from both my dad and our stepmom first. Stepmom's sister wore a dress with tiny white and blue flower embroidery on the bodice, and that didn't raise a brow either. When I went to a friend's wedding I was torn between 2 dresses, one that was green with black lace and one that was dark blue lace bodice with a white modesty layer underneath. Even though the blue lace was very dense and the whit was only noticeable up close I wasn't sure if it would be ok and opted for the green one.

He was there for a few night in the same spot and I wasn't sure if he had moved since he got there.  Well 2 nights ago, it was absolutely pouring rain and 50 degrees out.  Water was running over the little guy like a waterfall and naturally I felt bad for him, so I put on gloves and picked him off the wall and took him inside to dry him off.  He was mad at first, but when I started to dry him off with a small towel, he calmed down.  I don't really have any accommodations for a bat, so I turned off a lamp and hung him up in the lamp shade for him to dry the rest of the way off.  Then I turned off the rest of the lights and went to bed.

The following morning, he was still hanging inside the lamp shade, and before work I cracked open the window hoping he would find his way out.  I returned home 12 hours later and I heard music playing and saw the lights on.  I walked in and there were hundreds of bats having a party.  There were beer cans and pizza boxes everywhere and the place was just trashed.  I asked all the bats to leave immediately, but they all laughed and called me hurtful names.  The neighbors were pissed and thought I was crazy when I explained the situation, so I told them to go take a look for themselves.  The neighbors were astonished, but then also tried to get the bats to leave with no success, the bats even made the animal loving girl cry with their insults.

Eventually the bats turned off the music once they all were tired out, but started up again the next night.  I went over to the breaker panel and turned off the one to the living room, then closed and locked the door so they couldn't get in.  All the bats immediately became pissed and demanded I turn the power back on, but I refused.  I locked myself in my room hoping they would leave eventually, but they kept getting increasingly mad.  I heard them breaking a lot of my stuff and they have started threatening violence.  I'm stuck in my room at the moment, and I'm positive the bats can't get in, as I'm sure they're much too small to operate a door handle, but it's locked anyway just in case.

118,157,1697443005.0,Does the way the narrator speaks for his girlfriend in crashed the wedding bother anyone else?,"Before I start I know it’s a song this post is just for fun not to be taken seriously.


In the old busted song crashed the wedding the protagonist is speaking in present tense not past tense. This makes the narrative feel a bit off.
He says thing on Har behalf “the ring she got was lame she couldn’t take the pain she didn’t want a silly second name”
He also asserts “she didn’t want to stay”

Now my issue is in this narrative it’s all present tense. He has had no time for a length  dialogue between himself and his girlfriend.It is true she chose the protagonist but that does not mean she felt nothing for the man she was engaged too. He is speaking on her behalf when in the real time of the events which he is narrating in present tense he has had no time to speak to her making his views on how she feels biased conjecture.

The protagonist is assuming a lot of info without consulting her view.

If so what effects them?,"In my experience as a musician I would assume that every whip crack would be at least slightly different, due to rigidity, length, and/or speed, but in my very limited experience with whips, they all sound the same to me. I'm largely basing my possibilities on the guitar because it's what I have the most experience with.

Rigidity I think would have the largest effect, and more rigid whips would have a deeper tone similar to how thicker strings at the same tension as thinner strings have wildly different frequencies.

Length I think would be the next largest effect. If rigidity doesn't matter at all, then making a string longer without changing the tension would make the string higher pitched.

Speed I think would play the smallest part in any change, but with guitars specifically picking too hard can cause a string to sound higher than what it's tuned.

Expanding slightly on this, do whips have multiple harmonics in one crack?",NoStupidQuestions,1

176,229,1697434914.0,I resist buying overpriced drinks and sweets for myself but end up buying my friend at least $20-40 work of stuff a month?,"For example, I avoid conveniently buying a $3-3.50  bottle of soda and will wait 10-20 min to buy the $2-2.50 one. But when I get the cheaper one I sometimes buy my friend one as well, and I also buy a bunch of sweets that he has some of most of the time.

The reason why is because he doesn’t have a job or much money. Doesn’t have a job because he’s not a citizen/have a work permit and even though he can find gigs, I understand the difficultly because I used to be a bum as well.

So for me $40 on him is one hour of work a month, but he doesn’t have a source of income.

Here’s the problem.
1. When he had money he was stingy towards tipping and sharing. The one thing he did for me years ago when I had no job (he got life insurance money back then) is take me on a trip and paid for everything except food. I see that as generosity but also that it was to his benefit because he wanted someone to come along.

2. He has held off on buying a year worth of Apple Music for $60. That’s $5/month. So if $5/month is that much of a loss to him, what about me spending $20-40 month just to treat him?

Anyways at my job the shifts I work I’m either by myself or with another person, it’s rare there are 3 people assigned to the same area on the same shift. Anyways usually the next shifts will have a 15 minute overlap and our replacements will clock in and come to their assigned area and chop it up with the people clocking out soon. To be clear I have no problem with that and there are (very) few coworkers that actually just say hi and wait for an opening in the conversation to speak, but I hate with every fiber in my being when I’m having a full on conversation with my coworker and the next shift replacements will come say hi but not only that, but will exclude me and will ask only my coworker something pertaining to them and just start talking about that as if they didn’t see us already talking about something.

195,254,1697432791.0,Friend serving food on sex party - I am a bit concerned,"I am going to be quite brief as the question is real simple.

&#x200B;

So, for some time, my friend (F, mid thirties, no, not the same person) has been running some errands for one lady of the night here in the area. My friend is unemployed, toggles 4 day-jobs and lives like a student, struggling to complete her university thesis and be on her merry way.

&#x200B;

However, this particular job seem to be rather lucrative (hourly pay is great, although she works only couple of hours per week). We are talking ironing, cleaning... that sort of things.

&#x200B;

Now, since she developed really good relation with her employer, because she is literally a super person - caring, smart and GREAT looking, she eventually got an invitation to serve drinks and food on one sex party that is being organized soon.

&#x200B;

Now, since I have my fair share of life experience - it is my belief that this is recruiting.

&#x200B;

Question: Am I right? Is this recruiting? And what are some of the possible scenarios (just throw it at me, no matter how bad)? And, is there something to be done, should things take turn for the worse? Has anybody heard of or witnessed something similar? I mean, I know these are usually drug fueled parties, but... that only makes my assumptions worse. How often does catering personnel engage in activities? Are they considered participants as well? Or are they ""off limits""?

Even though I am worried and will do everything I can and know, to support them, there is always this overwhelming voice in my head, that just wants to be told I am good, I am loved, and compliments or interest.

Logically, I think the answer is yes but here for opinions, thoughts, reassurance. 
Edit: I actually use the heavy setting not normal setting. I assume with heavy setting- it uses higher temperature than normal

Same for clothes- the only reason I can think of to use it is for really soiled clothes.

Hi Reddit, I know the tittle is weird but I’m genuinely wondering if what I’m feeling is weird or wrong. So for some time now I (M22) have been thinking of buying a ps5, in the past I hadn’t bought one due to their high price. I began to save some money and nowadays I have the money to treat myself. Right now for some reason this console is in its all time low at my country, after doing the math I decided that I could buy it, all my friends have already upgraded and new games are already releasing only for new gen. I’ve felt like am lagging behind them when a new game we all want comes out and I’m the only one that can’t play. Today I went shopping and find it, I was about to pay, excited for the games and experiences I was about to encounter but suddenly I felt a wave of sadness. I remembered my old ps4 sitting on my desk at home. I decided to give it a second thought. I got home and turned it on, I hoped on some games and when I finished I looked at it and realize how much I love that console, it was the first console in which I played online and honestly thanks to it I was able to make friends back in school, all the experiences I had began flooding in. I know it’s hard for some to understand this feeling but I couldn’t imagine just disconnecting it, putting it in a box and just forgetting about it. I know everything has a cycle but I’m just feeling like I can’t end this one. So I know I will upgrade because life evolves and so does technology, I won’t be able to play with my friends and the new stories that come in the future but it just feels weird holding my controller for the last time after 8 years together. So Reddit am o wrong or weird for feeling like this? I just don’t know who to ask because I feel it’s such a weird thing what I’m going through.",NoStupidQuestions,1

I don’t even exaggerate these things as I have had someone turn left into my car for the sake of cutting me off when I had right of way, and they did not feel even a little bit of guilt. legally they were wrong on all accounts but still tried to argue the case? and if I didn’t act and swerve they would’ve driven straight into my body in the driver’s seat.

how does anyone not get fatigued over this? I dread jobs I’m applying to that are over 15 minutes away bc I cannot stand driving but the job market is dead where I live. everything is at least 10-15 minutes away so I’ve slowly stopped going shopping, running errands, getting food, everything, bc driving makes me so sick. I don’t even make any remote detours for fun bc it means more driving. i wish I could walk or bike without risk of dying on a massive highway without an airbag.

245,321,1697427787.0,How does foreign aid works?,"The U.S has given about 3.75 Trillion Dollars in foreign aid since the end of WW2. This number is huge but it's still less than 1 percent  of the federal budget. For context, this is less than the amount the U.S spent (over 4.2 trillion), helping its own citizens, part of it in the form of financial in a much much shorter period of time during the pandemic stimulus packages. Another way to understand this amount, is compared to the U.S national debt being over 33 trillion dollars. But also, this isn't pennies, for example, the U.S is giving Ukraine over 47% of the aid it is receiving, and the other 53% is a collision of the EU and other countries.

 (Also, just how massive is the U.S?)  


I understand this in comparing my own circumstances, in which my ""foreign debt"" is my vehicle and mortgage loan, a huge debt, and yet, I still come to make payments monthly, while being able to allocate about 1,000.00 a year for charity, after all my expenses, and putting money towards saving. If I bankrupt one day, it won't be because that extra 1k a year I donated, nor it will make a big different in prosperity. All good so far and I don't have any concerns or opinions against U.S giving foreign aid.

But how come the U.S gives money to countries, considered allies and also some, otherwise, consider hostile? I don't want to make this about politics and I'm not going to mention U.S benefactors by country but said list, seems to include nations hostile to each other or even the U.S

This is like if I donated money to the humane society and at the same time some Non-profit organization interested in the suffering of animals, the humane society strives to help

I try to rationalize it as just ""foreign policy and influence"" but then again, some of this aid seems to be going to nations which have no interest in alliance with the U.S politically or culturally. Some would rejoice in the end of the U.S.

What's the criteria then? Because, if it was to influence, wouldn't the most important factor in regards to influence, be  that in order to receive U.S financial help, first establish a Pro-U.S government, adhere to U.S/Western democratic values, open trade relationships...etc

I just am confused. I'm not pro or anti anything. I just am hoping to get better understanding on this subject. Also some of this otherwise hostile nations don't even have oil to claim it is because of the oil.

Sometimes on special you might find a pack of just thighs or just drumsticks, but it was not a regular item they kept in the cooler. Wings would be on a freezer shelf somewhere along with the ""weird"" meats like tripe or pigs' feet or beef tongue. (We used to buy them to go crabbing).

I 26f and my partner 28 M have been dating since I was 13 years old . He is my first boyfriend, I have lost my virginity with him and experienced all the stuff you would in a relationship, with him only. 
I have no comparison as I've never been in a relationship with anyone else but I feel like he is just not sexually attracted to me anymore . 

We have been through alot in the 13 years however we have always maintained a strong relationship.  We do everything together and have been renting a house together for the past 6 years. We share our Bill's equally and never fight about money. 

Up until about 1 year ago we have always had a healthy sexual relationship . However lately I found we barely have sex anymore and I feel like we are too young to start living like the old married couple if you know what I mean. I feel like I'm the only one initiating interest all the time but I want my man to want me on his own initiative. 

Now my partner is a very anxious person who had issues with depression and has started taking antidepressants about a year ago as well. I wonder do they have this impact on his sex drive . He is better now tough and on the way to stop taking his meds as his doctor is reducing his dosage .  I understand that he is always worried about what could go wrong in our lifes but I'm starting to feel confused at what he is actually feeling for me. 

I get so little attention from him romantically that I started to fantasize about other men and this is worrying me . 

I get more attention from strangers on the street or my male co workers and that is probably starting to mess with my head . 

I'm considering confronting him about this and asking if he is with me because he loves me or he is just used to me. We are saving for a house together and all these other commitments that are life long but if we won't be able to stay in a relationship this is all pointless.

I pay 300-400£ in bills each month.

And then I allow myself £200 leisure each month. Granted, I'm not necessarily struggling to get by, I know I'm relatively lucky in that sense but I cannot figure out a reasonable way to save up.

Even with renting, in my area id be looking at a minimum of £1000-1200 a month, unless I go down a council house route.

Adding in the debts, I immediately can't afford it. Then there's the part for the deposit.

The other side is no matter what, I always forget about some payments I have to make and end the month on practically nothing.

I feel stuck, and I'm not entirely sure how to move out ot my parents.

TL;DR: I can't afford to get my own place all the while I'm paying my family rent. What's the best way around it?",NoStupidQuestions,1

There are a whole bunch of anthro animal characters I like but if liking anthro animals is all you need to be considered a furry, that could mean that everybody is a furry. Winnie the Pooh, Sonic the Hedgehog, Animal Crossing, franchises where anthro animals characters aren’t the main focus but still have them, a lot of people like media where anthro animals exist but there are still furries and non-furries.

288,370,1697423834.0,Charge dispute through my bank for adult services,I messaged an individual through Twitter who was offering selling a folder of videos where he flashed consenting girls on omegle. He said it was $50 for the folder where he had 200 videos. I ended up buying what I thought was that folder through a link he sent using unlockt.me. It ended up being only a single video of not even what I asked. I messaged him on Twitter again trying to figure out why the folder wasn't in the link he sent and he promptly blocked me after my message. I have never used unlockt.me so I was worried about my account safety. I called my bank and asked them to deactivate my card and they're going to send me another in the mail. I also told them why I was asking for it and they offered for me to file a charge dispute and as long as I have recipts I should be able to get compensated. The problem is all I have is the direct message information. I am worried the diapute will be ruled againat me but also that my standing with my bank will deteriorate tremendously due to the nature of my issue and my lack of what I think is sufficient evidence. Should I call my bank and cancel the dispute or go through with it? This is my first time ever and I would rather just lose the money if I might get in bigger trouble.,NoStupidQuestions,1
289,371,1697423794.0,How can I (24M) know for sure that my best friend (23F) doesn't hate me?,"We've been friends for 11 years and to be honest, I don't really have a reason to think she does. But she's really important to me and I really enjoy her company. Every activity is more fun with her presence. But I'm always paranoid that I'll do or say something wrong or she'll get tired of me or something.

Like yesterday we spent 17 hours straight together (10am to 3am) and I do realize that most people wouldn't do that if they didn't want to. But also, part of me is worried that I overstayed my welcome and she didn't want to say anything to spare my feelings. I'd hope that she'd be comfortable enough to tell me she's ready to call the day off and I always tell her she can kick me out whenever.

And last night, at like 2am she was like ""What should we do now? Wanna play a board game?"" which I feel like she wouldn't do if she didn't want me there? But I also texted her today to tell her I had fun and thank her for driving me home and she didn't respond but she's been a bad texter for as long as I've known her and apparently is that way with everyone.

I guess asking her directly would work but I don't want to sound insecure and I'm also worried that she'd tell me that she doesn't mind my company even if it does bother her in order to spare my feelings.

I know I'm probably overthinking it. I'm just trying to figure out how to be assured that she enjoys my company about as much I enjoy hers.",NoStupidQuestions,1

So basically, you know how there are people with no arms or with no legs?

In a hospital, you basically cut off a person's hands and legs in a professional or surgical way.

Once that person has no legs and hands, you make them blind, and you make them unable to speak (like being mute)

So you get a person with no legs and no hands who can't see and can't talk.

Now for the special part, you connect them to infusion, feeding and nurturing them.

And that's it. That person can feel, breathe and hear, but they can't move, die, communicate or do anything.

In terms of being active, I’ve walked 10,000 steps a day for the last few years. It was a promise I made to myself to keep it up and it’s something that I very rarely don’t do.

The most common answer seems to be that fat people are lying to themselves which I believe somewhat to be true, I definitely was lying to myself at my biggest or maybe not even lying, just not being fully aware but I also do truly believe currently I’m eating healthy and not lying to myself. I’ve lost a really decent amount of weight in the past few years, I don’t lie to myself about how much I eat and in the last couple of months it’s just stalled. I’ve realised most people in the comments are US based so I’ll give both sizes I was always a uk size 18/20 or US size 14/16 and now I’m a UK size 14/16 or US size 10/12. I’m starting to wonder if my body is just incapable of being a smaller size. 

The main reason I ask this question is because for me to lower my currently calories I think the average calorie calculator online would deem it as “unhealthy” and too little. So I’m wondering if it’s common for people to just go into those “unhealthy” small amount of calories to lose weight but it’s not really discussed.",NoStupidQuestions,1
343,443,1697419019.0,"Are periods old blood built up over time, or is it bleeding freely from the body?","I've found so many accounts of people saying they get severely anemic/ill during their periods because of how much blood they expell during their cycle, so does that mean it's like an open  hole in the uterus and circulated blood drains from the body? 

It makes no sense from what I've been taught where period blood is old blood the body built up to potentially have a baby. How can people say they bleed out to the point of needing a doctor if periods are a preset amount no bigger than 1 cup of blood shed from the uterine lining? 

The heart is constantly pumping blood so it again makes no sense that someone could bleed to death if periods take a solid week to completly shed. The only way you could die from period bloodloss is if you got stabbed",NoStupidQuestions,1

347,447,1697419416.0,Would you rather say a lie or tell the truth when either way your an ahole,I just broke off a nearly 15 year friendship with a person I really never felt like I wanted as a friend. I know I'm an ahole. She always made everything about her. It was always a competion. She'd point out when I was off key. We had to listen to her music. She'd constantly compare our lives. We are both adopted but our adoption stories are very diffrent. She'd tell me that my past wasn't bad because others made it seem like theirs was worse. There was a bit of a delusion problem that even she admitted to. Like she wants to believe she invented words when she obviously didnt. For a long time I tried to brush it off. I tried to pretend it didn't bother me. I knew some of it went back to her disability and how her parents chose to raise her because of it. And she also grew up with a lot of privileges that cause her to throw literal tantrums when things dont go her way. We did have good times together. And she was there when nobody else had time to hang out.  But recent events in our friend group just made it hard for me to tolerate how we exist together. I'm absolutely no angel  and have a lot of baggage I've been working on for years. One of which is avoiding hurt feelings at all cost. I told her based off recent events that I felt like we were drifting apart due to her not reaching out when a mutual friend publicly asked her to. And she got defensive like she usually does and brough up how several months ago i stoped answering phone calls. To be fair yah i did but she knew it was because i work a horrible job with no ac and was exhausted. I had apologized and i had my friends add her to our dnd group. Huge mistake they did not like her. I now i can't take back what i said. It's already done. But would you have told her the truth in hopes she would change?

i like the idea of taking some time for my birthday, im in my 30s and never really had good birthdays growing up due to being poor and having bad friendships/relationships - im trying to correct this and “treat myself“ as an adult, but trying to do anything in the time frame of my actual birthday is next to impossible due to my intolerance to heat.

my question is, how do i “change” my birthday? i know i cannot do this legally, and this is not something i feel i need to pursue anyway. but all my friends know my birthday, and i would feel very weird telling them i am switching it to something like my “anti-birthday”... how do i “change” it so that the time i personally decide to celebrate and recognize it is also celebrated and recognized by friends? i live abroad, away from my immediate family, which feels like it might make it easier - i dont have to attend anything organized w/o my consent by family - but still idk how to explain to friends; for example, that yes, they know my birthday is in august but suddenly i decided it is in february! how do i “transition” folks into a “new birthday” for myself??? or am i overcomplicating it?

I've been wondering why gathered end hammocks aren't more commonly used for sleeping for a long time. These hammocks offer several advantages:  
Cost-Effective: They are much cheaper traditional beds, I got my fav one for $39.  
Space Efficient: When not in use, they take up almost no space.  
Easy to Clean: They are machine-washable.  
Breathable: Their thin material is perfect for hot summer nights, turn a fan on and you get a breeze all around you.  
Versatile for All Seasons: They easily accommodate under quilts for warmth in the winter.  
Relaxing Sway: Gentle rocking can enhance sleep quality.  
Low Installation Cost: You can set them up in almost any room without a significant expense.  
What's your take on this? I can't see any downsides unless you're wanting to sleep with your partner that night, and some hammocks you can fit 2 people in kinda. Do you have any insights or experiences to share about using gathered end hammocks for sleeping?

Help!,"In my opinion i think this is not normal as I frequently question if i am attractive enough for him or not, or whether there is something wrong with me or that he doesn’t love me anymore. A quick background about our relationship, we are from the middle east, therefore our religion and culture does not allow to go out on dates or have sex before marriage. We met on Instagram and started talking on the phone on daily basis and before we even get in a relationship we started sexting. The sexual attraction was always there from the beginning. Until finally he came to propose and we got engaged. In the beginning he was nervous even if we were alone in the car he hesitated to touch me. But when we were alone in my room its all normal and he gets more relaxed, so i thought maybe he cant do it in public (i mean show affection) not even a kiss. But when we got married and moved in together (in an apartment building behind his folks house that they built for their kids) he kept stopping me when i tried to touch him. And i am an attractive (26F) i get lucky once or twice a month. I thought its stress or he has a-lot on his mind. But this also happens when we go on vacations, we went to Italy and greece and we had sex once only. Its frustrating for me because i crave him so much.

Just recently i’ve talked it about it with him. And he told me that this is how he is and that his sexual drive is low. I tried to ask him few questions like why he doesn’t have a boner when he sees me naked? He said only animals have boners without foreplay ?!.. it gets worse whenever i ask a new question.

396,510,1697415647.0,I asked her to study and things turned out… different. How do I go about this?,"
I 22m asked 22f in my class to study together and she said yes. Probably not a big deal to most but I’ve just started to put myself out there again.

We met last month and got along really well our first day meeting. We exchanged numbers (for academic reasons since we’re in the same group) and she said we should go eat out together sometime. Anyways, I basically texted her id like to get to know her but if she’s seeing anyone I don’t wanna ruin that…. She didn’t respond to it and then she didn’t respond to me anymore after that.

After about one full week of no contact, she sends me a message saying how her mother came from Europe and is staying with her for two weeks and she hasn’t been on her phone that much. She added it had nothing to do with me (I asked her if I did something to be getting ignored). She then texts me asking if I have the book for our class and I said yes but she didn’t ask for it. So, 8 hours later I’m like ""do you want me to share it?"" And she responds one minute later saying ""I already found it finally hahaha thaaaanks"".

I then decide to ask her to study together tomorrow and she responds by saying ""yes we can !"" And we agreed to a time. The thing is, when we met today, she was so touchy. She touched everything from my notebook to my laptop and would lean in so close to me we were like face to face and were looking in each others eyes. Truly distracting especially for me. When I’d leave and come back she’d just stare at me and ask me where did I go etc. We talked about everything and our backgrounds. 

Our convo got so deep that she cut it off with a big smile and said ""we have to study"" (looked like she was having a playful tone while she said it almost like she likes the distraction). Long story short, I saw her Lock Screen when she received a text and there was a photo of her and some guy (girls only do this when they’re dating someone) and I instantly got turned off. We ended up taking the train home together and when I completed how she speaks three languages she looked at me deep in my eyes and didn’t say anything but just smiled. When she got off she turned around to wave at me.

I don’t know if she’s dating someone or if I even saw that was really her or her mother on her phone screen but I’m getting pretty paranoid. Advice ?",NoStupidQuestions,1

My practically would suggest if we're in a dying off as a species we do the best we can and make those who remain comfortable. Often stories make it a top priority for the species to survive. Why? I'm for protecting everyone who exists. But why does the species specifically need to survive.

An example that might help. At the climax of Interstellar, Dr. Brandt gets left alone, lonely distraught, overwhelmed, with ingredients to try to seed Earth-like life and humans on a new planet, far away. They believe this will never help anyone on Earth. (Ignore the magic ending and gravity flight. Pretend things had gone as they expected.) Why is it better to do that than to stay with loved ones and do the best you can with them? In the United States, I think we usually glorify fighting, winning, surviving. There's also the Hufflepuff virtue of being there to ""die with them."" To help and support even when you're no longer free of the mess.

437,563,1697412139.0,Am I the asshole for ghosting my friend after he friendzoned me?,"So I have a friend that is 2 years younger than me. I have known him since 2020/2019, (he is my mom's friend's son, and they visit like twice every year) but I did not become ""friends"" with him until 2022. 

I do not have many friends. I am friends with him and his sister, and that is it. I barely get any attention from guys, at all. Like I have never been asked out or crushed on. Guys do not approach me or look at me either.
 I started to develop feelings for my friend because he was the only person that would talk to me. However he has always liked my younger sister who is the same age as him, but I thought he might have been over the crush. (He had liked her since like 2020/2019).

We had a lot of fun when everytime he visited. When he was here, me, him and his sister would have play fights. We would play video games together, go outside together (the all 3 of us) and so on. And I remember specifically that 1 night only me and him stayed up till like 5 am and played video games together. I really started to like him. 

Whenever he was not here we would have a lot of contact online, like chat and play video games. Being the dumbass I am I overshared with him (like I always do with every person that just gives me a little bit of attention). I literally shared my whole backstory, like all my insecurities, weaknesses, strengths, goals in life etc without me knowing any of those things about him. And he comforted me. 

After a while I asked him if he still liked my sister, and he said yes. I asked him why he liked her and he said it was because he thought that she was really pretty and that he misses the close friendship they used to have. 
Then I asked him why he always spoke to me if it was my sister that he really liked, and he said ""because when I talk to you I feel like I am talking to a friend or bro, but when I walk to her it feels like my life depends on it"". 

To act like I did not have feelings for him I just said that I could help him get to know my sister. I suggested him and her going ice skating or playing something together. I also made a groupchat with him, her and me in it where I was supposed to help him impress her or get to know her. 
I am not a backstabbing person, so I kept my word and helped him, although it hurt.
I was so hurt by the fact that he liked my sister, that I cried for weeks.
 I tried to force myself to lose feelings for him, which worked. I managed. I did not want to try to make someone love me when their heart belonged to someone else. 

I started to slowly stop talking to him. He always messaged me and joined me in games, but I sent him more and more short responses. I started to ignore him. And eventually he stopped trying.

Now today him, his sister and his mom came to visit. They are staying for like 5 days,  and I did not greet him. I completely ignored him. I did not try to initiate conversation, have play fights or play games like we would usually do. I did not even look at him. However I did still spend time with his sister. I spoke to her, played with her, etc. 
I noticed that he looked at me sometimes, it seemed like he was kind of sad. (Not because he likes me in that way, but because he might feel left out or like he lost a friend which he looks upon like a ""big bro"" although I am a girl.)

He tried to sit besides his sister when me and her were talking, to include himself. But I pretended like he was not there. 
Then me and his sister play fighted, and he tried to include himself. He threw a pillow at me but I pretended like it did not happen and ignored him. 
Me and his sister tried to carry each other. When she tried to carry me, he asked what I weighed (just to start conversation I guess) and I did not look at him and just said ""62"". He did not try any further.

And when I used the computer and played a game but also had my YouTube music playlist out, he came up to me and watched what I was doing. He tried to talk to me and ask what I was doing, but I did not really respond. 

I encouraged my sister to go play video games with him, and she did. 

The whole reason I ghosted him is because he friendzoned me, and I do not want to catch feelings for him again and get hurt once again. And I knew that he liked my sister, so I would not try anymore to ""earn his heart"" when he likes my sister anyway, even though we were close friends and he barely knew her. 

I also do not want a bunch of male friends. I want a male friend and that male friend would be my future boyfriend/husband, but since I know I will not have that with him I do not want to remain friends with him for my own sanity and morals. 

I feel like I am being selfish and an asshole. I mean he does not know why I am doing this. He did not know that I liked him, and it is not like he did anything wrong. He is not in the wrong for not having feelings for me and friendzoning me. It is more like I do not want to get hurt again.

The guy I started the interview with pulled in three other people one at a time. The last of those people was the CEO. He didn't like that I'm not currently doing accounting work, so he ended up offering that I take time to prove that I can do the work and then seeing if I would get hired. (I would get paid for that time. I also ultimately declined and am still job hunting.)

I don't want to get into the whole experience, just wanting to ask about something he mentioned when coming up with the above proposal.

450,577,1697410934.0,Why do people hate tax season when it seems like you get money back?,"Maybe it's because I haven't made much so far. There seems to be a dread towards tax day.

I always feared taxed day growing up. My parents took my papers to a tax preparer and I was trained to do that growing up. Last year I made the most gross amount of money ever which was 31k. I also prepared my own taxes. It took 2-3 hours for my first time doing it which isn't horrible. Just one W2 and a school 1098-T. It sounds like I will be getting back 3,000. Which tells me would you be happy about tax day because you get money deposited back?

Next year, I will be doing maybe towards 100k but for 2024 it will be 102k.

Here's what I'm thinking:

My family is kind and has helped me out plenty already, but they're in hard times economically too, and can't help me right now.

I've tried Gofundme in the past and shared it with friends and family, but it doesn't go far and I rarely get much at all.

My rent is 965 and with the late fees it's gonna be about 1075.

I live alone a noteable distance from family and have nowhere else I can stay right now if I lose my apartment.

I have a car I intend to sell, but my Pops is fixing it up a bit for me so I can actually get something for it and I'm doubtful as to how fast it'll sell.

And I don't have anything else that's worth a sell.

I've about 8 days to get my money, but other things in the way of me working most of this week.

Is there any legal way at all you can think of that might help me keep my apartment?

We'd been talking on and off for about a week and a half. They asked me to move our conversation to Line app. I said okay and then copied my Line link and sent it to them. They asked what the link was and I told them it was my Line profile link. They told me they weren't going to click on the link because they couldn't verify it. I do understand that. I don't click on random links my friends send me if there's no thumbnail, so I generally ask what it is, and then depending on their answer, click/delete the link. So this person I was talking to on Tinder refused to click on the link. They then sent me their ID. I haven't verified my age or service provider on on Line app, so the only way I can search for people is by profile link or QR code. I told the person I was talking to this. They asked me to add them by QR code, so I sent them my email address. They then started questioning me about my name. I gave them my real first name. In the end, this person refused to send me their QR code via email and we continued talking on the Tinder app per their request. They told me they had been swindled out of 650,000 dollars. Supposedly, someone contacted them and asked them to invest 100,000 in real estate and this person did it. In a subsequent email with this person who they gave 100,000 dollars to, the person sent my ""friend"" on Tinder a link. When my friend clicked on the link, somehow this person was able to get into my friends bank account and remove another 550,000 dollars without my friends knowledge. I asked my friend how on earth this happened and my friend said they didn't know. I was SHOCKED to say the least, but didn't want to press the issue. Then my ""friend"" starts talking about how they almost made all the money back through Bitcoin investment. I was like, Aw shit. Is this person going to start asking me to invest in Bitcoin. They didn't, but they started asking me of I'd ever been scammed and did I know anyone who was. The whole conversation set me on edge. I was watching everything I told them. Wishing I hadn't told them my real first name or given them my spam email account. Eventually, the conversation ended, but I felt uneasy about it. Was a person who said they'd been scammed trying to play the victim card and scam me? I unmatched them on Tinder which means unless they wrote down my spam email or link to my Line profile, they'll lose the information in our chat unless they took screenshots.

605,779,1697395772.0,Has any commoner's revolution not fail directly due to the interference of foreign powers?,"I am aware that most successful revolutions have been supported by the middle-class and military powers. The two that I think of as as closest to a successful 'People's Revolution' where the lower class masses have gathered to seize power from the upper class are the formation of the Soviet Union and Hati. 

I know Hati is the strongest case because it is a slave rebellion turned, but even then the offspring of slave owners and their slaves became sort of a middle class and supported the revolution with their expanded rights, powers, and privileges. Afterwards there were internal disputes and the other nations were quick to stomp out any chance of it being inspiration to any other slave rebellions, the effects of which can be clearly seen today. 

I know these are more modern examples though and I imagine there might have been a time when a king or some equivalent was not so powerful and a uprising of the peasantry might have been successful. I understand the thought of the average person in the past was very different than today. 

The Catholic Church had a lot more power as a propaganda tool before the enlightenment period and many asian countries were either in a collection of tribes of clans where power changes hands too often to really be considered a revolution each time or the powers that be were so well established that their people were as brainwashed as the Western nations under the Church's influence.

Even if you don't use all the local ingredients the people in France used to create the dish, you could just import the ingredients directly from France. Why do people act like you have to go to the home country of that food dish to get a 100% authentic experience? If a French person, used the french recipe, and french ingredients imported, how is that not 100% authentic? Even if a non-french person made it, if they followed it how the french person did that's still 100% authentic french food in the U.S. You would just be missing the setting of France while eating it. But even that you can recreate in other countries by designing your restaurant or outside of your restaurant a certain way.

I feel like a lot of cultures are really stuck up and stubborn about their food and grasping for something to proud of their country for, because truth be told if they didn't obsess about their food their country would have nothing going on. Maybe this is a newer thing and younger generation thing? I notice that children of immigrants who desperately want to be apart of their parents culture and nationality will be super anal and gatekeeping what is and isn't authentic and what tastes good or not.

About 2-3 months ago I received a note from the post office in my mailbox (the ones that have post-it glue, colored orange) telling me I had an undeliverable package, and at the bottom it says ""dog cut off"". I went to the post office where my packages were, and questioned the counter clerk, very calmly, no arguing or being rude by me or the clerk, and the clerk politely told me that when a dog was reported, they no longer  would get out of their truck to deliver to me, if it didn't fit in the mailbox, they wouldn't deliver it. 

I then called the national USPS customer service line and explained my situation, the CSR was great, and was surprised that the dog cut off statement wasn't in her system, but assured me that she would forward to my local post office for action. Less than 24 hours later I get an email telling me:

""After reviewing the information provided, due to issues with dogs in your area in the past, your block is designated a dog cut off area. What this means is, for our carrier's safety, they are not allowed to exit their vehicle for any reason, so any parcel too large to fit in your mailbox or any item that requires a signature will be noticed and will need to be picked up.""

  
I don't own a dog. There are no dogs roaming my neighborhood, though in the 11 years I've lived here I have seen maybe 2 dog running through, with an owner in pursuit, so I can't say no dog has EVER been on my street, but those are rare outliers. So I'm literally innocent of doing anything to cause whatever has happened, and now I'm told that my USPS branch will NEVER AGAIN deliver packages to my address??

  
Please tell me if I have any recourse here. I could even understand if they said this would go on for 6 months then review, or even a year, then review, but forever???  
Thanks for reading.

  
TLDR: USPS won't deliver my packages due to a dog cut off issue, I don't own a dog, and they say this ""penalty"" will be carried out in perpetuity and never be rechecked. I'm asking if I have any recourse available to have this no delivery order rescinded. ",NoStupidQuestions,1

623,802,1697394510.0,Why do people brag about gore tolerance? Am I sensitive for criticizing them?,"Let me specify before I start that I’m talking about /real/ gore, not fictional 

Is it valid for me to be frustrated with these people? People online have called me sensitive or acted superior to me. I absolutely never go around telling people that I call losers for bragging about how unbothered they are by gore about my experience but I feel like it should be common sense to not brag about being able to stomach something you have never experienced 

When I was around 12, I saw my mom’s ex boyfriend get stabbed to death right in front of me. Before that, my brother would joke around on gore websites and make me watch from time to time. I wasn’t hugely impacted by it but I was squirmy and grossed out 

My brother was with me during the incident, he hasn’t joked about or messed with real gore since 

I mean I know for a fact that at least a large majority of people online that sit there and brag about being unphased would NOT be unphased if they witnessed something like that in real life. Especially seeing how it impacted my brother who found that sort of thing entertaining like a lot of people online do. 
It happens a lot horror fandoms. A lot of horror fans will talk about how they’ve seen so many horror films that they don’t care about real gore and just no. How. I know it cannot be because of my experience solely because I know many people who haven’t had experiences that still know the common sense on how different real and fake gore are. I’m a huge horrorhead and I LOVE fictional gore. I do sfx shit and I cannot associate fictional gore with real gore whatsoever and I know it may have to do with my incident because before it I remember always seeing fake gore and squirming so hard and imagining it as real but it was still always missing that feeling. After seeing the real thing, no matter how realistic it looks on screen I just don’t think about it in any real sense 

It’s nothing about the gore itself that makes real shit hard to stomach. It’s the dreadful aura and feeling of someone before they’re about to die that makes it disturbing and I genuinely don’t know how someone could go about being “unphased” with something like that considering its something I felt in those videos even before the incident. And why someone would want to brag if they were because they obviously have some issue if they are. The core thing that frustrates me is when people act like it’s something that makes them better. Like how I mentioned a lot of horror fans try to act superior to others for being unbothered by it.

I try to look at it from a perspective of some people find it “entertaining” to watch gore due to their interest in the human body. But that makes absolutely no sense considering there’s such a massive and more DETAILED variety that actually educates and most of the videos they watch are like 3 pixels",NoStupidQuestions,1

708,914,1697385051.0,Was is flirting etiquette?,"My whole life I’ve been taught by women, teachers, and online culture that I need to… I guess be careful when I talk to women? Sparingly talk to women? Idk it was never really clear.

I was kind of told it’s not ok to flirt with women because it’s sexual harassment or I’m making people uncomfortable. I’ve been also told the worst places to do it are at school, work, bars, and if I see a woman enjoying being out on her own anywhere, I also shouldn’t really bother her by flirting.

So I don’t really know what to do. I kind of just wait for them to say or start something because I don’t want to be a bad person or seen as creepy or overbearing. 

I also don’t know when it’s appropriate to touch them. Again I’ve always waited for them to do that. 

I’ve had long terms relationships. Upwards of 5 years. And at the start of each I would make sure not to even sit on the same couch as them because Im afraid they’d feel uncomfortable like I’ve always been told.

And as a single person idk if I’m flirting with someone or their just being friendly. Idk if I’m aloud to gently touch them here and there to show some slight physical intimacy. Like something as small as holding their back gently while walking through crowds. Or giving them a cute shove when they say something goofy or funny. Or holding their hand to compliment their nails or bracelet. 

And kissing is out of the question. I won’t do it until they straight up ask me. 

The risk of being a bad person is way greater then the reward of someone by chance being into me. 

So what’s the etiquette? How are you supposed to flirt? When is it ok to talk to women? When is it overdoing it? What should my expectations be? Should I just be friendly and wait for them to initiate something? Is it sexual harassment and I should just take the risk? What’s the line between friendly and intimate?

745,962,1697380973.0,Am I gonna get a girlfriend again? (OCD & relationship issues),"Hi all.  
  
I'm 23 years old and have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and lately I've been thinking I might have some mild psychosis too. I'm saying this because most of the time my thoughts drift away from what's real and sometimes no longer know what is the true thinking way. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist but most of the medication didn't work and therapy... Well... It didn't work that well either. I want to ask you a question about one part of my problems.  
  
I'm actually a normal person with most of the stuff in life but when it comes to relationships I just lose my mind and don't know & think what to do. What do I mean by this? I had 2 girlfriends until now. When I was 16 and 21. The first one didn't last longer. The second one lasted for 1,5 years. And now I can't find anybody else. And I'm thinking about the possibility of not being able to find a girlfriend for the rest of my life or a very long time like 5 years, 10 years, 15 years... This thought is driving me crazy and it's making me lose connection with the reality. I no longer can think properly. I'm thinking about all those worst case scenarios where being single forever or ""What if I'll never find anybody else?"", ""What if I'm unlucky or there's a spell over me that's gonna make it impossible for me to find another one?"", ""What if this?"", ""What if that?""...  
  
Having a girlfriend means a lot to me. I guess this is why I'm having these thoughts. I try to think like a normal person but it doesn't work:  
  
\- ""Of course I'll find somebody else. Everybody does.""  
\- ""I just need to get socialize, meet with people.""  
\- ""Nobody knows the future. It's very uncertain. I have to focus on now.""  
  
NO. Sadly these kind of ways of thinking don't help me at all. I have intolerance towards uncertainty and it's making me suffer a lot and I can't get that idea of being single forever out of my mind.   
  
English is my second language. I tried to do my best while writing. If there are some mistakes I'm sorry in advance.

**In short, my problem is that I'm afraid of the possibility of not getting another girlfriend. Is this possible?**  

Thank you.

756,975,1697379542.0,Does Fingerprinting Everybody All The Time Really Keep Anyone Safe?,"My brother's youngest just graduated from high school.  For like 15 years he's been a ""parent helper"" at the school, going in to paint sets for the high school plays and do all kinds of other stuff, band booster, basketball Dad, lots of things.  Every teacher in the place knows him (it's a small school and all four of his kids went there).

He no longer has any kids at the school, but some of the kids there are friends of his daughter who just graduated, and he's still friends with the other parents. The fall play is coming up, and so one of the other Drama Club Parents asked if he would be back to help out.  He said sure, and then the school board came up with like a dozen forms he has to fill out.  Proof of covid vaccination and some others, well, fine, but they never asked before.  And they want him to get fingerprinted and have a background check.

He thinks that's idiotic; he's been at the school longer than several of the school board members have been office.  And then we got to wondering: does taking all these fingerprints really have any positive effect on student safety, or is this just a way to funnel a bunch of money to companies that do background checks?

One point for him is that he has never been fingerprinted.  His prints aren't in any database anywhere.  If he does this, now they will be, and that's bothering him.  I told him it's no big deal; I had a job with a security clearance once and I'd been fingerprinted and had a background check.  He replied by mentioning cases where people were wrongly accused or convicted of crimes because a fingerprint at a crime scene was incorrectly matched with their fingerprint, which can only happen if your fingerprint is in a database somewhere.  Sure, it's rare (but maybe not as rare as we hope it is), but it does happen.

Then I got to thinking about how after 9/11 the government went bonkers with spying on everybody, spending billions of dollars to no good purpose, and never actually catching a single actual terrorist.  Is this another case like that?  Is there any actual evidence that fingerprinting everybody all the time genuinely works to prevent crimes?

I've been friends with this lady since 2018. I liked her a lot, so did she. She gave me all the green lights possible, saying I'm the perfect type of guy physically, asking multiple times why I've not asked her out, I'll just give the generic excuse that its not about her, its me.
I'm sure you'd be wondering what I was waiting for. Well, I do have a Small dick, and she was usually vocal about liking big dicks, talking about wanting to 'feel full'. Even going as far as mocking guys with Small dicks, wondering how they manage to survive with the 'shame'.

So our friendship has been fine since then, though she was clearly getting frustrated as she refused to hang out several times during subsequent years. She moved to a different city in 2021, and we've barely communicated on phone since.

Anyways, I travelled to her City recently, and guess who i ran into. The meeting was pleasant enough, until I mistakenly suggested to catch up. She begrudgingly accepted, even stating she may not have the chance, and I hope thats the case.

This sounds like something that shouldn't really be an issue, so why am I worried about catching up with a friend of 5 years? Well, I do kind of feel like I've not been fair to her. Women rarely show their intentions that overtly, plus I didn't meet her by chance, I actually cold approached her, so obviously, her confusion is understandable. Our relationship has deteriorated over the years, and I do kind of miss her. Outside of hating Small dicks, she's a nice person to be around. 

If I have the chance meet up with her before leaving,  I'm thinking of opening up to her, and telling her the reason why I've never tried to ask her out.

i (22f) have been doing a lot of self reflection lately and i have noticed there has been one commonality across almost all of my relationships that have ended (both romantic and platonic). almost all of these relationships have ended with the other party telling me that i deserve better than what they can give me. i’ve noticed this because when i look to my parents and their generation i see them with friends they’ve had their entire lives and i can’t help but feel a tinge of jealousy. now, i know that i’m definitely not alone in this experience as a lot of people in my generation are feeling so isolated and lonely. i don’t know if it’s social media, a change in society, or if i am really the problem. i’m left wondering is saying this an easy cop out to get out of a relationship or friendship you no longer want to be in? i guess what i’m asking of you, redditors, is if you’ve been the one to say “you deserve better” to someone when ending a relationship did you truly mean it? or was it a way for you to cut ties with someone in an amicable way? i know there aren’t very many details in this, it’s more of a stream of consciousness that i’d like to know other’s opinions on. let me know what you think!

And my personal take is that if you don't want to be friends with someone that has a baby, (especially when you're still teenagers), that should not be frowned upon.  Obviously there are right and wrong ways to go about ending a friendship in any context, but I just think that if you are that young, and your peers are having kids and you are just not comfortable to have to start hanging out with that friend and their child, you shouldn't have to.  And you shouldn't be shamed for not wanting to.

I’m not religious, nor do I think I necessarily have conservative values - yet I’m bothered by my partners low number of previous sexual partners (4) despite it being the same as my own. I’ve had intrusive thoughts and obsess over details, which made me think it’s OCD/retroactive jealousy - but when those thoughts subside I’m left with an underlying “feeling” and think about the number of past partners my girlfriend has had. I don’t necessarily feel disgusted, or fearful of anything - I just don’t like it, and it sits in my mind mostly all day every day. 

I know I love my partner, I know I see a future with her, and if any of my friends came to me about this issue I’d tell them 4 previous partners is next to nothing and to not worry about it. But why do I feel differently? Why do I hold myself to different standards as I hold my partner? To me, having 4 previous partners is nothing - I was made fun of at uni for not having enough “fun” and for having a poor dating life haha. 

If this is a deeply ingrained misogynistic trait from my own mind, can I change this with time? I’m aware that my thoughts are unfair and hypocritical, and I’m aware they’re preventing me from being fully happy. I don’t want to be in a relationship where I’m always low key holding something against my partner, but I feel this thought process will follow me to new relationships - and I don’t necessarily want a virgin partner. 

I want to change my thought process and become more accepting, and stop holding double standards. But is this truly possible? Or am I stuck like this forever? Because if I am, I’m going to live a very sad, lonely life.

The thing is, I don’t actually know if they’re homeless or not. Their signs usually say something along the lines of “family fell on hard times, need money for food, god bless,“ etc. I’m afraid of offending them by assuming their daughter might be cold at night.

My husband had an organ transplant. If you weren't aware, you need to take certain medications to prevent your immune system from attacking the new organ. Now Medicare was paying for the medication up to three years after transplant, which ran out this summer. So we had to use our private insurance, which wouldn't cover it because they prefer a different brand. My husband can't take their preferred brand because the side effects interfered with his quality of life. So we appealed and they agreed to cover it.

Well, the doctors changed his dose. So we were waiting for the insurance company to approve it, the doctors to give prior authorization (whatever that is) and for the pharmacy to get the ok. For. A. Month. Thankfully we had a backup supply that he could use but that ran out over the weekend. Two days worth of phone calls led to us learning we had to appeal it to the insurance company again because even though it's the same medication it was a different dose. Then I had to drive an hour round trip to a different pharmacy because the one down the road didn't have it.

Are other countries like this? Does your insurance company have the final say in what medication you can take based on who they have a deal with? Is it this hard anywhere else to get critical medication?

So here we are on this catwalk with all our kids and, like, the absolute bare minimum for railing, and Bob says, “if anyone fell in this water they’d sink straight to the bottom because it has no oxygen.” 

 There, that’s the whole reason for this post, I promptly scooted my kids out of there while other kids climbed all over that railing for a better look. This has always bothered me, because it seems so dangerous and I don’t know why Bob or anyone else would think that letting 40 ten and under children run along that cat walk was a good idea. 

 Last night it occurred to me that maybe Bob was actually full of poop and had no idea what he was talking about, that would make me feel better. Like, knowing that if a child had fallen into that water an adult could have rescued them would make me feel better. (I should say here that it did not appear to me that there was some other safeguard in place, but maybe someone who is familiar with water treatment plants knows that there would have been). 

 So, is there water that a human body would be unable to float or swim in, and is it likely that the water at this treatment plant was in that category? Was this as dangerous as I felt it was?",NoStupidQuestions,1

I've noticed that when I become erect, my penis can be different sizes each time. Sometimes, it's closer to 6.5 inches, and on other occasions, it can reach up to 8 inches. This natural variation has left me wondering about the factors that influence these fluctuations and whether other guys experience something similar.  
  
I'm aware that many factors can affect penis size, such as arousal levels, temperature, and even emotional state.

On the same subject, how strong must my handshake be? I've been told to always have a firm, strong handshake. But I've felt bad when the other person was, for instance, an old man or a little girl. And then, what counts as too old or too young?

Over the year we stayed in touch and would have times where we would try to work on things, have sex, go out etc. 
It turned ugly because I found out he was on dating sites while telling me we are working on things, also he'd like womens Instagram pics which is one of my pet peeves. Just alot of disrespectful shit. Anyways so we'd set up days for him to get his belongings maybe like a bag here and there, we'd always end up having sex talking etc and ""trying again"". 
But this time I moved on and he doesn't want the relationship either. 
But now he wants to sue me for money I owe him? I don't owe him money. The only thing may be that the puppy (we got together**) destroyed his couch. The dressers and bed, those items have been in my house for a year. He never made real effort to get them. Now he wants them a year later and wants to sue me. I told him he can have the dressers but the bed is staying because I've slept in it alone for a year and he bought a new bed anyways so him wanting a bed that isn't even in great condition (cause of the puppy, he left me to raise alone!) .

It disgusts me he wants to sue me because my parents actually bought him a car while we were together, my family did more for him in a year than his whole family has done for him, he lived in MY home for a year I did his laundry, cooked, cleaned, we had a great relationship while i was pregnant. He did pay half my mortage which helped  but thats expected of since he lived in MY house.
I'm just disgusted by him that he may actually sue. Idk if he's bluffing or what. 
I believe the rules in PA are he abanded his items and never got them within 30 days.
He never made attempts within the 30 days after moving out to get bed or dressers. A year ago. 
He's maybe mentioned throughout the year but our schedules wouldn't work out, he didn't have help, no storage unit yet, etc etc always excuses. And then sometimes we'd fight and I would say no I don't want you anywhere near my house but this was said 6 months after his bed and dressers were left without him living with me.

i have had multiple friends do this to me regarding other people and it only makes me wonder what the hell they are saying behind my back when im not around. i think a healthy discussion of “oh when _ did this, it kind of made me feel _” is fine, but anything else being said about someone when they aren’t around is not. can you still be a good friend to someone while talking about them behind their back??? this isn’t normal right?????",NoStupidQuestions,1

Anything I say is LAW!"" Then when you ask why they act that way, they shut down the conversation entirely by blocking (online situations) or call the cops on you because they don't agree that you disagreed with them (real life situations). Does anyone know why? If I'm wrong, no matter what for, I discuss like an adult why or why not I am wrong, and have a basic debate like a normal human. But a lot of people I met seem to not be able to do that. 

Example:

I respond ""I do not believe you are correct, could you enlighten me as to how you came about that thought process?""

381,494,1697521731.0,"Is it stupid to expect true love, and leave if I don’t find it?","I’ve been a little bit (translation: extremely and debilitatingly) lonely recently and well, I’ve been fairly confused about how I should act / what I should expect when dating. I’ve always been fairly emotionally sensitive/fragile, and I don’t think it’s healthy for me to date people if I don’t get the quantity of love I feel I need.  I’m very scared of the possibility of love dying out over time, and I really have become almost depressed at the thought that I will never find a person that will reciprocate as much love as I want to give.  

I feel like dating someone whom you have ceased to be in love with is unfair to you and to the person you’re dating, but I’m also scared if I spend my life searching for the perfect person I’ll run out of time and end up alone.  I know fairytale love is rare, but anything less seems almost depressing.  I have a need to love and be loved, not just passively, but I feel I need to be IN love. I fear that that need will forever be unfulfilled, and it’s taking a huge toll on my mental health.  So much so that I’m often finding myself crying at night, and having to distract myself from thinking about it, because the moment I do start thinking of it I just can’t stop.  

So, if I’m in a relationship and the fire goes out, is it reasonable for me to leave, even if we still love eachother?  When I hear people talk about their relationships, it’s almost always depressing.  Of course there’s the occasional one that gives me hope, like [this](https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/s4OnlapYgQ) one,  but is it reasonable to search for that type of love, even if it means giving up relationships that many people would stay in for the rest of their lives? 

I’ve made the mistake of scrolling Reddit for a few years and I’m sure the sheer number of depressing stories on here have affected my judgement of relationships, but normal love just doesn’t seem like it’s enough for me.  I feel like if the love fizzles out, I’d become completely overwhelmed by the fear of missing out on the possibility of “true love” that I would become a bad partner, and I don’t think it’s fair to stay in a relationship if that relationship will never fill your desires, the whole idea of “settling” seems so wrong to me, if you’re “settling” that means that there’s something better out there, and you’ve essentially just given up, and that is not something I would ever want to do. 

And what happens when the love does fizzle out? Especially if you’re married the way people talk about it seems like they just accept it and never go back to being in love again.  I don’t know if I could handle falling out of love with someone I thought would be the one I loved forever.

So, here’s what I want (need) and feel like is unattainable.

-a relationship where the honeymoon phase never ends (or at least where you stay in-love like the post I mentioned [(this one)](https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/s4OnlapYgQ)

-a partner that needs and wants me as much as I need them

-a partner I feel secure with, and who always has my back

-someone I can look at and no matter how bad I’ve been feeling know that my life matters so much more because of them, and that I would give anything for them.

I know people will say I am putting too much emphasis on this part of my life, but I can’t help it, it’s the purest desire I’ve ever felt, it’s unwavering, unquenchable, and all devouring.  Everything I do now, is depressing because I realize I could be doing it with someone I love. It’s like a switch suddenly flipped and I realized I’ve been seeing in black and white my whole life, but the only way to see color is to go through a lifetime of heartbreak and pain, uncertainty and anguish, just for a chance to feel the love I so desperately need to feel.  So, what the fuck do I do?  And to those who have these mythical relationships where your love doesn’t fade, how do you keep that? And to those whose love has fizzled out, what changed from the honeymoon phase that made you and your partner drift apart?

Apologies for the long post, this is sort of half because I want answers, and half because I feel like writing out my feelings helps a bit.  Also, as you probably guessed, I’m fairly young (early 20’s) and sort of trying to understand my fears and feelings.",NoStupidQuestions,1

I gotta say. We're nowhere even remotely close to that level of autonomous intelligence. As rapidly as it's evolving, it's still very much dependent on human input, as humans are the ones who need to create the machine learning/deep learning instructions and feed it to the AI. Also, ask ChatGPT how many ""e's"" are in the word ""elephant"", or ask it to solve a calculus problem. Yeah. I don't think we're gonna have to worry about AI taking over our jobs anytime soon.

Today, she came to class wearing a band tee that’s mine and I didn’t know she still had. I acted surprised and told her I wanna wear it this weekend to a concert I’m going to. No response from her except a laugh. 

Normally at the end of class she would walk over to me smiling and make chit chat. This time, when class ended, she put on her headphones and walked away fast. Then whenever I walked past her on campus again she was ignoring me — didn’t make eye contact at all. Find it weird for someone who spent the whole day yesterday cuddling and watching movies with me. And kissing me even more than she did by the end of our relationship. 

She had told me on Wednesday that she would only reach out to me once and then that if I wanted to see her again, the ball was in my court. Yet she was the one to ask if she could come over again twice. And then last night I think she wanted to smoke with me and I told her we could hang later in the week. I asked her when she’s free and she said she would let me know. “Okiee ill lyk”. I didn’t see reason to text back.

I have this artwork which occurred naturally, and I feel as though some type of rich collector might find it appealing enough to pay a lot of money.

I mean, it's uncanny how picture-perfect this artwork is.

It's simply a rough cut panel/board/plank of wood. The woodgrain, for some strange reason, created an unimaginable looking copy of some sort of shark.

I worked at a lumber mill awhile back, I watched thousands of boards of wood pass by me on a conveyor belt every week. I'd see all kinds of woodgrain-images which vaguely resembled faces/objects.

One day, a board of wood came down the line and I just so happen to notice this work of art. I asked a nearby saw operator to roughly cut the image out of the board, kind of like a plaque that you'd hang on a wall. 

I now own this thing, this completely natural image of a shark. The board of wood is about 9 inches long, 1 inch deep, 4 inches wide. 
The woodgrain shark took on a dark green appearance, it even appears to have varying degrees of ""shading."" As if it were painted on by an artist. 
It's unmistakably a shark, a very detailed shark.

479,620,1697510878.0,Is it better to call someone out or just leave in silence?,"Specifically, I've been dealing with a now former coworker who, I don't know what her true motive is anymore. She's a married woman with 3 kids.

At first, I thought she just needed someone to talk to. But I guess this became an emotional affair because of how she'd compare me to her husband. She invited me over, ""off the books"", and while her husband and kids weren't home for what I now assume was a physical affair. But I'm assuming the husband showed up cause she abruptly cancelled last second.

Since then, she became obsessive. Texting me all the time. Getting upset if I didn't text back (but it's okay if she doesn't), listening to her issues or even coming to talk to her. She even texted me, ""were you here and didn't come say hi to me?"". She's even physically chased after me on more than one occasion.

Now that she doesn't work with me anymore, she finds some excuse to text me or call me every 3 months. It's been her car breaking down, asking stupid questions about the Internet or even something marvel movie related. But she won't answer me after a while and it's annoying.

I know the easy answer is the block her. But I still physically see her because she's still involved in a way at work and we see each other at sports games.

Part of me really wants to just completely call her out. Like when she calls answer saying it's her backup husband speaking or something. But I know the passive route may be easier but she always loses her shit if I go radio silent on her.

I have some common sense so im not going to just yell out ""hey guys look at me im depressed"" or so on, but if I get into a conversation and I feel as if I can comfortably speak on a sensitive topic with this person-- I will. Whether I've known them for a few minutes or a few years. Of course I won't speak on things that I may still have shame from or embarrassing stuff that if it were to ""be used against me"" I wouldn't really care.
But when I was doing this, the other party was fine but my mother got annoyed and angry that I would go to these people about it.
Now I was very confused from her reaction so I went to a friend for a little help and they said ""maybe she just doesn't want you to tell everyone your business,""
which if it had anything to do with her I wouldn't have said anything since it's not my story to speak on...But this was MY story and I was telling it to people who's been vulnerable with me and genuinely gave me good advice.
So I guess, that being said is it wrong to be open? I feel like I don't struggle with social ques and I know there's a time and a place so... Idk Im just a little confused.

in case anyone asks for specific information. 
tw; SA?
but what happened was I was 
Basically groped by a co-worker. It made me feel very gross and uncomfortable. 
I went to my mother (who works with me) and well we didn't really talk about it. She's just the type to not want to dwell on stuff like that while I need to release how I feel to other's or in general.
Well I still struggled with believing it wasn't my fault it happened so I came to these 2 older women coworkers of mine that are very open and accepting. I told them what happened and I was told to report to HR...which unfortunately I will not be doing.
They spoke to me about ways to protect myself etc and overall how to not be a naive 19yo girl 😮‍💨
but my mother took it as me claiming she didn't care because I should have came to her first about it (i did)
and then it just blew up.
I know I'm young and naive so im still learning, my judgment may not always be right ever... But my mother threw it in my face and essentially blamed me for what happened and accused me of acting too grown and giving my trust too easily.

I'm trying to get a state identification card, while being unable to visit a BMV near me (Ohio).

I've had my drivers license for 10 years but I didn't make the deadline to renew before it expired. I'm severely agoraphobic nowadays and I'm unable to leave my house. The covid lockdowns created such anxiety and stress in my life, and being unable to do anything or leave - just left me homebound. Overtime it developed into a major condition.

However, as I'm unable to leave my house, and the closest BMV is 25 minutes away - which is completely outside of my comfort zone; I'm just unable to go there. The issue arises when I can't get any online doctors to assist me because they can't verify my identity. I can't seem to do anything anymore without some sort of identity. I can't start an online business because I can't verify my identity to accept payments, I can't manage crypto because of the same reason. I can't do anything without getting a state ID card.

Is there a way, or an organization that's able to help people in my situation?

I'm back in the U.S. now, and I have a job I originally loved, but it's starting to kind of suck. I'd read some less-than-flattering things about the boss on company-review sites, knew it could be true, but took this job anyway. It's good money, I need the health insurance, and it's work I know how to do fairly well, which always brings with it some degree of satisfaction.

But recently, the boss has become ...let's just say....how they were described in company reviews online. I'm seeing how everyone, myself included, is stressed, stretched way beyond their capacity, and working to meet unrealistic goals set by the boss. Plus, we're all having tasks handed to us that are not in line with our actual position because there's no one else to do these tasks.

I told my boss I'm at capacity last week, and they nodded with faux-sympathy and added another massive task to my roster (urgent, of course), a task that another employee, stretched way beyond capacity, has no room to handle.

I'm even being messaged by my boss on weekends, though I don't answer.

I had read online that my company culture is terrible and that the stress of this place will be unmanageable, and I'm a cynic who always assumed companies suck ass by default, but this is wild. Everyone walks (or types, as we're remote) on eggshells around this person. It's completely wild. I feel like I'm in a TV show.

why do people make jokes about getting the runs or being chained to a toilet after eating certain food so much?

This has only happened to me once in my documentable life. I went to a diner while traveling 3 days in a row, and the food was mad greasy, so it did give me uh.. somewhat loose stools. But other than this? I’ve always just pooped like normal. The times when I do have looser stools (diarrhea is such an ugly word. I can’t bring myself to say it), it’s always due to either illness or menses. Never diet. 

I know that if your stomach isn’t used to the grease, it can affect you. But I grew up barely eating fast food since my mom was a stickler over it, and yet I still have never had my waste affected when I consume fast food.

Obviously I do not have the most income at my disposal, so I am looking at the low-premium high-deductable plans available to someone like me. 

What I don’t understand is this- I am a healthy young man who will maybe see a primary care physician once a year, which upon googling, will cost me anywhere from $100-$200 per visit. That’s lower than ALL of the monthly premiums I am seeing. And then a specialist visit could be $300-$500, but if I still haven’t reached my deductible, that means I have to pay that out of pocket, which is kind of like I don’t have insurance at all, no? If my deductible is $7,000, that means I have to see 14 specialists per year at $500 per visit before the insurance company even starts doing what I am paying into it for. That’s absurd! And I don’t even get vision or dental on this plan, so I ask, what even is the point?

Is this normal?,"I'm in my early 20s, so I'm supposed to be in my sexual prime. But I can't help but feel like sex is a chore. People my age go on and on about how great sex is, some even do stupid things or put themselves in risky situations just to have sex, but I often just sit there not really understanding what all the hullabaloo is about. I wasn't raised in a religious household, but sex was never talked about, almost taboo. Unlike most people in high school, I graduated high school having never has sex, let alone kissing anyone. So I wonder if that has anything to do with it? Maybe not really being allowed to have sex or explore intimacy as a teenager like most people do killed something in me unconsciously. I remember even after my first time, which was when I was 18 after graduating high school, the guy that I was with I was really attracted to physically and emotionally. We had sex and then I thought to myself, ""Is that it? Is that all there is?"" But I remember when I was in high school I almost had a constant hard-on. Maybe never having those desires fulfilled as a boy turned me off under the surface, but I'm unaware of it 

I've been told to try different toys, different kinds of lube, different positions, to change it up, and I have done all that. It all just feels so repetitive: in and out, in and out until you ejaculate, and the same for your partner until they ejaculate. I'm gay and I once had a guy who didn't douche beforehand and when I penetrated him after awhile I realized there was poop on my penis. That was two years ago, so I'm over it, but I sometimes do think about that. I've had sexual partners comment on how I often seem confused or disinterested or stare into space or look bored when having sex. It's odd because even with someone I find hot it's never really been fulfilling in the end. Even when I was 18 and I was new to sex, I found that I sometimes wouldn't even get erect.

646,833,1697496905.0,How common are Happy Ending Massages really?,"For context, I’m a young woman who just moved to a major US city. Lots of strip malls advertise these cheap and quick massage parlors behind curtained windows with generic names like “Sun Spa” etc. I’ve had two friends who have anecdotally visited spas that included some kind of “happy ending” that they weren’t expecting.

I’m in the market for a cheap massage, but I’m seriously hoping to avoid that kind of “mix-up” altogether. This has literally stopped me from going to get one, as I become doubly convinced that the price is reflecting the additional services and not the quality of the massage itself - and that even if I do bite the bullet and say “no thank you,” it’s probably not gonna be the best massage because that’s just not the spa’s focus.

For context I’ve only gotten massages in sports therapy settings and once or twice at a hotel spa.
I’m at the point where I’m convinced that every cheap walk-in place is gonna mean I have to clarify that it’s not a sexual thing. God forbid I say something before and they’re literally a wholesome family-run spa. But also, god forbid somebody touches my butthole before I can say “no thanks.”

1:When the question arose,it first showed itself on paper relatively quickly in the convo,so while they could have thought it was ""dividing in half"" instead of dividing by half, the equation already showed 300/0.5 on paper,as well as the 300/2 to clear up that possible misconception.

Some days I'd wake up at 2am, other days I'd wake up at 5pm.I had a routine for a few days, it would get disturbed, throw me into a new routine that would last 4-7 days. So I had a different sleep pattern every week. 

I'd come down and my mum would ask me something like ""Have you just woke up?"" I've had this conversation enough times to know it's not a real question. She already had the answer in her head and is just waiting for me to give that answer so we can have an argument over it. So instead of answering her, I call her out on it. Tell her she already knows what the answer is and every time we have this conversation it devolves into an argument, so why even ask the question. It replaces the initial anger she felt with embarrassment because she went in with an expectation of how the conversation was going to turn out and I flipped it into calling her out on her behaviour.

So the technique is recognising patterns in somebodies behaviour and using that to deduce what their motivation is and then instead of having the conversation go the way they planned you've used that information to flip the topic back onto them and now you're talking about their behaviour instead of your own.

We do a lot of volume and when we started there were three pharmacists to cover including me. But last week the other two have left and it's just me. We're a retail store and we open early at 7am and stay open late until 11pm for people who work different schedules, and were open like this M-F, and then 7am to 9pm on Saturday, and 7-7 on Sundays. With just me here I'm working every single one of those hours since I'm the only pharmacist and you can't open a pharmacy without me legally, so last week I literally worked over 100 hours. I can't even leave for a lunch or dinner break because one I'm so busy I barely have time to eat, and two we'd have to close the pharmacy down while I'm gone.

To make things worse, my owner thinks that since I'm a ""professional"" I need to just put up with the hours and deal with it. He thinks it's unprofessional to sit down at all while working since we're a pharmacy. There literally isn't a chair in the whole building. But refuses to buy any of those cushioned floor mats. I have to wear business casual shoes as well for our dress code since he thinks the pharmacists need to dress professionally not in sneakers or anything, so I wear a pair of ballet flats everyday.

Hi, so I keep hearing about countries like the UK and Sweden having a lot of criminals that are immigrants. They form the same street gangs that are very common in the poor unsafe countries they came from.

What I don't understand is, why is criminality a risk with immigration specifically? Imagine if a native hang out with a group and assaulted someone on the street, they would be arrested. What makes an immigrant doing that any different or any more difficult to deal with?

I was kind of told it’s not ok to flirt with women because it’s sexual harassment or I’m making people uncomfortable. I’ve been also told the worst places to do it are at school, work, bars, and if I see a woman enjoying being out on her own anywhere, I also shouldn’t really bother her by flirting.

So I don’t really know what to do. I kind of just wait for them to say or start something because I don’t want to be a bad person or seen as creepy or overbearing. 

I also don’t know when it’s appropriate to touch them. Again I’ve always waited for them to do that. 

I’ve had long terms relationships. Upwards of 5 years. And at the start of each I would make sure not to even sit on the same couch as them because Im afraid they’d feel uncomfortable like I’ve always been told.

And as a single person idk if I’m flirting with someone or their just being friendly. Idk if I’m aloud to gently touch them here and there to show some slight physical intimacy. Like something as small as holding their back gently while walking through crowds. Or giving them a cute shove when they say something goofy or funny. Or holding their hand to compliment their nails or bracelet. 

And kissing is out of the question. I won’t do it until they straight up ask me. 

The risk of being a bad person is way greater then the reward of someone by chance being into me. 

So what’s the etiquette? How are you supposed to flirt? When is it ok to talk to women? When is it overdoing it? What should my expectations be? Should I just be friendly and wait for them to initiate something? Is it sexual harassment and I should just take the risk? What’s the line between friendly and intimate?

I'm 23 years old and have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and lately I've been thinking I might have some mild psychosis too. I'm saying this because most of the time my thoughts drift away from what's real and sometimes no longer know what is the true thinking way. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist but most of the medication didn't work and therapy... Well... It didn't work that well either. I want to ask you a question about one part of my problems.  
  
I'm actually a normal person with most of the stuff in life but when it comes to relationships I just lose my mind and don't know & think what to do. What do I mean by this? I had 2 girlfriends until now. When I was 16 and 21. The first one didn't last longer. The second one lasted for 1,5 years. And now I can't find anybody else. And I'm thinking about the possibility of not being able to find a girlfriend for the rest of my life or a very long time like 5 years, 10 years, 15 years... This thought is driving me crazy and it's making me lose connection with the reality. I no longer can think properly. I'm thinking about all those worst case scenarios where being single forever or ""What if I'll never find anybody else?"", ""What if I'm unlucky or there's a spell over me that's gonna make it impossible for me to find another one?"", ""What if this?"", ""What if that?""...  
  
Having a girlfriend means a lot to me. I guess this is why I'm having these thoughts. I try to think like a normal person but it doesn't work:  
  
\- ""Of course I'll find somebody else. Everybody does.""  
\- ""I just need to get socialize, meet with people.""  
\- ""Nobody knows the future. It's very uncertain. I have to focus on now.""  
  
NO. Sadly these kind of ways of thinking don't help me at all. I have intolerance towards uncertainty and it's making me suffer a lot and I can't get that idea of being single forever out of my mind.   
  
English is my second language. I tried to do my best while writing. If there are some mistakes I'm sorry in advance.

**In short, my problem is that I'm afraid of the possibility of not getting another girlfriend. Is this possible?**  

Thank you.

139,179,1697379542.0,Does Fingerprinting Everybody All The Time Really Keep Anyone Safe?,"My brother's youngest just graduated from high school.  For like 15 years he's been a ""parent helper"" at the school, going in to paint sets for the high school plays and do all kinds of other stuff, band booster, basketball Dad, lots of things.  Every teacher in the place knows him (it's a small school and all four of his kids went there).

He no longer has any kids at the school, but some of the kids there are friends of his daughter who just graduated, and he's still friends with the other parents. The fall play is coming up, and so one of the other Drama Club Parents asked if he would be back to help out.  He said sure, and then the school board came up with like a dozen forms he has to fill out.  Proof of covid vaccination and some others, well, fine, but they never asked before.  And they want him to get fingerprinted and have a background check.

He thinks that's idiotic; he's been at the school longer than several of the school board members have been office.  And then we got to wondering: does taking all these fingerprints really have any positive effect on student safety, or is this just a way to funnel a bunch of money to companies that do background checks?

One point for him is that he has never been fingerprinted.  His prints aren't in any database anywhere.  If he does this, now they will be, and that's bothering him.  I told him it's no big deal; I had a job with a security clearance once and I'd been fingerprinted and had a background check.  He replied by mentioning cases where people were wrongly accused or convicted of crimes because a fingerprint at a crime scene was incorrectly matched with their fingerprint, which can only happen if your fingerprint is in a database somewhere.  Sure, it's rare (but maybe not as rare as we hope it is), but it does happen.

Then I got to thinking about how after 9/11 the government went bonkers with spying on everybody, spending billions of dollars to no good purpose, and never actually catching a single actual terrorist.

158,209,1697377410.0,Why do people act like high interest rates on cars are such a big deal?,"First off, I'm gonna start off with the fact that interest on everything right now is ridiculous. It's entirely too high in general, and on something like a house, it could literally change your mortgage cost by more than $1000/month by paying a 7% interest rate vs 5%. So that's definitely notable.

But my question here is about cars specifically. Interest has a way smaller impact on a short-term purchase worth tens of thousands of dollars.

Just for fun, I configured a 2024 Honda CR-V and compared the monthly finance cost at different interest rates. With my configuration, the car came out to $36,175 on their website (I'm sure this would be higher at the actual point of sale because if dealer fees, etc., but that's beside the point). Right now, Honda has a promo where a 5 year loan is at 4.9% interest, which is decent. 

The monthly cost for a 5 year loan on a $36,175 car with 10% down (which are all pretty standard terms) is [$671/month at 4.9%](https://i.imgur.com/v5j2V7a.jpg). With 0 changes except bumping the interest rate to 7%, the monthly cost goes up to [$706/month](https://i.imgur.com/5Y7igM6.jpg).

At the monthly scale, that's a $35 difference. That increase is negligible in the grand scheme of things. Even by the end of the loan, you will have paid a grand total of $40,260 on the 4.9% rate vs $42,360 at 7%. Yeah that's an extra $2100, but again that's over the course of 5 years, so it's only $420/year.

I'm not saying this to get people to try to buy cars. Shit's expensive rn. Yall do what you want with your money. All I'm wondering is why an interest rate a few percent higher takes a car from ""affordable"" territory to ""not worth it"" for so many people when the total monthly cost difference is <$50 in a lot of cases",NoStupidQuestions,1

recent YOASOBI went to Korea and they had an interview with some Korean person.

That was nice. And in head in the Clouds 2023 festival some young Kpop people interacted with Japanese singers but it was like the first time they met a japanese person.

176,234,1697374407.0,"Most police departments nowadays have strict ""don't pursue"" policies which claim to result in fewer deaths/injuries of innocent bystanders. Has anyone researched if this effect holds up on a macro scale?","I've wondered this, since these policies started rolling out a decade or so ago. I feel like we should have enough data by now to answer this question.

There's no doubt that for an individual incident, the decision of police not to engage in a high speed pursuit lessens the danger to the public. But does it also encourage criminals to engage in riskier behavior, knowing that they have a lower chance of being caught? 

Say that enacting such policies have caused a 50% reduction in public risk on a per-incident basis; if criminals feel empowered to do more illegal things as a result, and deaths/injuries in aggregate are 2x higher...maybe we're actually better off going back to the old model.

I know you could argue this same thing for other things like some cities' decisions to stop prosecuting certain low-level crimes.

215,287,1697367680.0,Contact lenses?,"Hi! I got some really dumb questions. Basically it’s been around 8 years since I’ve found out I can’t see well in the distance. Of course as time passed I started seeing worse since I didn’t wear glasses or contacts or anything and here I am today having trouble seeing clearly even when I’m 1 meter away. I also have this issue where my eyes get really tired when I’m at college, I have to wipe them frequently through the day because they feel so uncomfortable and I also rarely get some tears in them. I was thinking of maybe going to the doctor and getting some contact lenses (I’m not wearing glasses no matter what) and perhaps in the summer I could look into surgery since I believe I’m too young to start struggling with contacts from now on for the rest of my life. I also sometimes get teary eyes when the wind is blowing hard in them so I’m afraid maybe they might be too sensitive for contacts? Or can anyone wear contacts? Are they less expensive than glasses? I know glasses are quite expensive and I don’t want to buy those just to wear them for 1 year + I hate the look. I’m also quite afraid of putting them in, I don’t want to scratch my eyes or anything like that. I also heard they can fall, does that happen often? And the most important and dumb question: I have a really good tolerance when it comes to screens. I play video games for 5 hours a day every single day and do not wish to stop or do anything that could minimize that time. If I get contacts I assume it should be better, right? My eyes would be more rested and it won’t negatively impact the time I can spend in front of a screen, either pc or phone, right?.. I just won’t bother doing anything about my eyes issues if there’s even a tiny chance I won’t be able to spend the same amount of time in front of screens anymore. I nap everyday because I do feel tired, but even when I don’t feel that tired I still nap to rest my eyes. Also how would the doctor appoinment go? I hate not knowing what’s going to happen. I hope they won’t be like „try different lenses and see when you see well enough” because I would have no idea what would be a good enough vision.

225,299,1697365954.0,"Is there scientific evidence supporting the hypothesis that the human brain operates in two distinct modes, one of production and another of consumption?","I have been pondering the idea that the brain operates on two distinct levels or modes, and I am unsure whether this concept holds scientific validity. My hypothesis revolves around the notion that our cognitive processes can be primarily categorized into two modes: production and consumption. I believe that these modes are fundamentally different, each pertaining to specific types of tasks.  
  
In the mode of production, individuals are actively engaged in activities such as cleaning dishes, playing games, musical instrument performances, or even walking. During this phase, we are essentially executing actions, relying on our existing knowledge or immediate environmental feedback to guide our actions. This mode appears to be the opposite of consuming information, as our primary focus is on output.  
  
Conversely, the mode of consumption pertains to activities involving the intake of information, which could include reading books, watching television series, listening to a speaker, or simply absorbing information from our surroundings. This mode revolves around information reception rather than active output.  
  
Remarkably, there exists a unique medium in which both these modes coexist harmoniously, and that is the act of having a conversation. Engaging in a conversation entails both the production of thoughts, words, and responses as well as the consumption of information through active listening and interpretation. The simultaneous utilization of both production and consumption modes in conversation results in a distinct and pleasurable experience.  
  
One fascinating observation I've made is that when I engage in the mode of production for several days in a row, I often experience exhaustion, and my mind naturally gravitates towards seeking a balance by shifting into the mode of consumption. Conversely, after extended periods of consuming information, I find myself inclined to engage in productive activities. This cyclical interplay between production and consumption is of particular interest to me.  
  
My question is whether there is any scientific basis or research in the fields of neurobiology and cognitive psychology that supports or contradicts this hypothesis. Can the brain truly be categorized into these two modes of production and consumption, and are there any known mechanisms or processes underlying this differentiation?

234,310,1697365295.0,How do I make a song stop having triggering effects?,"I went through a very traumatic breakup last year (we were together for 3 years) and they sent me a song that broke my heart so horribly i forced myself to go to therapy that same day. 

While it gave me horrible anxiety and hurt so much to listen to, I couldn’t stop for weeks on end, every day. (We broke up in August, ended up being my #1 listened to song on Spotify wrapped)

We ended up getting back together, and we’ve been dating again for a year (4 years total minus 3 weeks last year). Thing is, even still that I know it’s in the past and it’s all fixed, just hearing the first note of the song, or the title mentioned in casual conversation, I immediately feel the rush of all that despair and pain come back to me. 

This song can almost instantly cause a panic attack for me, and I hear it more often than I would like even when it’s just out and about on the radio or playing in stores. I had to be put on PTSD and anxiety medication just to deal with daily life from how hard this song broke me.

I want to get over this. I’ve tried exposure therapy, purposeful avoidance, mental preparation, everything my therapists and psychiatrists recommended me. It doesn’t do anything, and anytime it gets stuck in my head I feel so uneasy and physically sick to my stomach from the painful memories it brings back. 

I don’t know what to do. SO doesn’t connect music to memories like I do so they don’t fully understand or always remember that it is triggering to me to hear it (it’s still on their playlist, but to be fair it is a really good song musically).

In the seven years of my adult life I've been through ups and downs but it's mostly been downs. Recently though, I feel like things are actually getting better. I'm finally building resilience to setbacks and I'm actually feeling determined to get out of unhealthy patterns. I understand myself and my emotions better than ever.

I decided I'd try giving dating apps a shot a few months ago. Took me a while to build confidence to use them, but I'm getting matches now and it's providing me the promise of change in my life. But I'm extremely inexperienced in everything related to dating, all the way down to just making friends with someone.

I feel like I waited too long and should use the energy I have now towards making the best of the dwindling opportunities I have left. I know the right person won't care about inexperience, as long as we can hit it off. Me withdrawing doesn't make this easy though. So while I feel some rush, I also feel with every match I withdraw from or don't give my all, that I'm really just not ready for this yet. Still too much hurt and internal trouble.

244,323,1697363915.0,Is permanent hair dye supposed to hurt?,"I’ve been dyeing my hair blue regularly for the past 6-7 years and wanted to switch to permanent instead to reduce how often I bleach my hair. So far so good, but the last time I used permanent dye— a couple months ago— it stung so bad that I was like rushing to get it out as fast as possible. For the record, it’s not like I’m sensitive to pain. I’ve gotten tattoos, piercings by hand and a couple surgeries so I’m no stranger to long periods of discomfort lol.

Yesterday, I got some more permanent dye and as I started my game plan, I decided to skip lightening. My hair is faded into a minty green at this point, but it’s still pretty light. Especially since my hair is usually medium to light brown. My roots still aren’t really visible either, so I can probably get away with it.

But is permanent dye supposed to do that? I see mixed responses and nearly all of them assume that the permanent dye is to go blonde or something. To my knowledge, permanent blue dye is still a new thing which just adds to complexity.  Some say the stinging is normal but others say it’s an allergic reaction. 

I do patch tests with this stuff and haven’t noticed anything of concern. And I don’t think it’s a chemical burn because when I rinse out the dye, the stinging immediately stops.

If it helps, I have fine but thick, medium to light brown hair. Im trying to be careful because last week, I was switched from testosterone injections to temporarily using testosterone gel. Gel is known to cause baldness faster than injections, and while both sides of the family have full heads of hair in their 60s and 70s, I still don’t want to gamble with it.

If it’s not supposed to sting, I’m going to bite the bullet and return to semi-permanent. I know people say to leave all this to a cosmetologist but I’ve tried ones in the county with mostly bad results. Whether it was damage to my skin/hair or just a bad dye job overall, I’ve had less bad experiences by myself than with people around here.

253,335,1697362122.0,How to handle it?,"Lately, (24M) I've been having this strange feeling stucked in my heart whenever I saw a bisexual man (stranger even) in a heterosexual relationship with a cisgender or transgender woman, but not with a femboy. It's hard to pinpoint if it's a hint of jealousy, disappointment, or just a sense of regret. I don't know. For example, individuals like Ronen Rubinstein from 911 Lone Star, Ezra Miller, and Zach Rance from BB'16. It's perhaps similar to when a man who identifies as gay ends up marrying a woman or a heterosexual man who claims to be bisexual but never engages in anything with the same sex, constantly praising women for the sake of content (OF, J4F, Cam, etc.) for gay or bisexual men who are thirsty after them. Strangely, though, if he's straight, I have no issue whatsoever. Is this somehow related to the erasure of bisexuality? Or is it biphobia?my inner insecurities? Or I still can't accept their happiness? Personally, I am open to and don't mind to pursue a relationship with a curious, heteroflexible, or bisexual  cisgender man, as long as they are willing to commit a serious relationship with me.",NoStupidQuestions,1

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Context of my situation**  
\- I'm an adult living with 3 narcissistic and abusive people - 1 parent, 2 grandparents. My parent doesn't want me to be independent so I haven't been able to leave the house in months, with no signs of that changing. I haven't been able to get a ""real job"" as none of the many I applied to actually seem to be interesting in hiring people.

\- Recently the only stray cat I was close to was killed (by accident - I feel like I should also note it that it was a grandparent that killed it not me!) and I'm in desperate need of a companion, I just can't bare being here otherwise. There are other strays at the house but they don't come near me and I try to limit the time out of my room anyways.

\- This will be my first time adopting so I'm very new to the process. The application form I filled out had lots of personal questions like the birthdays and full names of people living in the home. After applying I got an email stating they would be doing a property check. At first I thought it just meant they were gonna look up the property on google maps, but after looking up info about adoptions I understand it means they'll be coming to the house.

I have several concerns + questions presented below.

  
***tldr: I'm an adult living with abusive hoarders, can't leave the house and unemployed. Cat died so I want a companion. Property check will be done. I have several concerns and questions.***

  
**I live with hoarders**  
There's lots of junk and food sitting outside and inside the house, key guest areas are mostly presentable but from you can definately tell there's a problem.

  
Will they be satisfied if I just direct them to my organized room where I plan on keeping the cat or will they want to check inside every room and around outside?

  
**I'm unemployed**  
I make money online but didn't mention it as it's not consistent and I didn't want questions about it.

Will they have a problem with me being unemployed? We have plenty of cat food and the person I mentioned in the application works constantly. I have saved enough money to purchase neccesities, and ubers + tip to and back from the humane society if need be.

  
**I don't have transportation**  
As mentioned before they don't like my leaving the house or being independent. I live in rural country so I can't just walk.  


I'm prepared to pay for an uber but I was wondering if it would be weird if I asked if they could deliver the cat to me? I would be willing to pay them for the trip + tip like I would pay uber.

  
**I don't have a traditional vet**  
There is someone that comes by and takes the cat to the vet for free whenever we have trouble. I didn't provide her number becuase I didn't know it, my parent is the one that communicates with her. I didn't want to ask her either because she always brushes me off and would've got upset at me for even daring to talk to her.

  
I am prepared to take my cat to the traditional vet if I need to, but I'd need to save up if it costs money to register with them or whatever you do. Honestly our current situation would work out in the case of an emergency, but I'm assuming that it's not sufficient enough.

  
**Made some mistakes on the form**  
\- I made some embarrassing mistakes on the form like leaving the roomates section blank because I wasn't thinking of them as roomates I had.  
\- I only mentioned my parent because I don't know the grandparent's full names or birthdays and due to reasons above I wasn't going to ask them.  
\- I mispelled the cat's name & used a different name entirely by accident.

  
Should I just consider myself fucked or is it possible it won't come up/ will be understandable mistakes? I wonder if I'm better of going to breeder but I can't afford it.

339,435,1697336830.0,How to deal with overthinking?,"Throwaway account for reasons.

I'm a 37 year old guy. Never had a woman take interest in me. I met a wonderful lady last year. She has put in the effort to know me regardless of my looks, etc. She sees my negatives and my insecurities, and accepts them as part of me. I really like her and want to make this work to a point that I can spend my life with her. However, things have been difficult for the last 5 months or so. We don't live in the same city. She has told me she's not a phone person (whenever we've met, I've never seen her use her phone). I've spoken to her mother a few times and her mother has the same problem with her - that she doesn't use her phone as much so communication is difficult.

Recently, She's been busy and preoccupied with various things in her life. During our early days we would talk 3-4 times a week, mostly video calls. She would reply to my texts sometimes. But these days we barely talk at all and she doesn't respond to my texts either. We did get to talk a couple of weeks ago and she apologized a lot - told me she's sick and dealing with other things and she'll make things better soon. She even said she knows I'm worried about this situation and she isn't planning to leave me/ghost me.

All of this is causing me to overthink a lot.

I see one of two situations:
1. She's not really interested in me anymore (I did make my intentions pretty clear early on that I do want this to end up in a marriage or a similar commitment. We met on a dating site after all). She was just being nice to me and continues to be nice to me, but thats all it is. I should back off and accept this.
2. Given she's not a phone person, and given she has said she's dealing with a lot in life right now, I should just continue to give her space, be patient and be there for her. If I really want to marry her, I should treat her problems as my own, and right now the only thing I can do for her problems is give her the time and space to deal with them.

I genuinely like her a lot but I feel I'm reaching the end of my patience. I've been ghosted a lot in the past and this does seem similar. However given what I know of her, and given what she's said, I don't think she's ghosting.

So far I haven’t gotten any mail or anything regarding what debt I have specifically, but I have gotten emails telling me to check my student loan account stuff.  

I’m kinda just asking how long until someone finds out.

There is no running away, as I’m dealing with the government or my grandparents who would hire a private investigator, and they have gone to prison for attempted murder before so…

I'm assuming the hidden text would have been 1 pixel wide, and the background may not have been a flat color, so I'm thinking that something like a light beige and a yellow might look very similar normally but the darker colors when inverted would have made it easier to separate the two?

464,598,1697335936.0,Do you think society dismissed Christianity to make people weak?,"No stupid questions so here goes, i’ve been thinking about this recently. I’ve always been an atheist(?) but I do think that most religions (that i’m aware of, I am not well versed in every religion) are probably all based around things that may have happened and stories of people that may have existed and done good/ bad things although I have struggled to see the “God” side of things. 
I know there have always been issues and horrific things throughout human history no matter of religions existence but I think that I was influenced growing up to dismiss Christianity even at school I was taught about it but there was never a drive or push towards any belief which i know they can’t do at school because it’s about education and not opinion (well it’s meant to be although it doesn’t seem that way anymore) 
I feel like since Christianity became less popular that our standards of how we act as people has seriously declined. Was it the case that older people were scared of doing bad things because of God? I’m not saying that religion makes you perfect and as I already said i don’t consider myself religious at all but have our standards fallen since we dropped mainstream Western Christianity? 
And the headline question, do you think this could be a bigger thing because the only things that seem to have ever brought people together no matter your background have been money and religion. 
I watched kingdom of heaven (a movie about the crusades) and upon further research the fact that a thousand years ago so many countries were brought together to fight side by side by Christianity alone is impressive and nothing like that has ever happened since? Money is only available to few who can pay people to support them but religion is basically free to everybody and could bring people together as it has in history.
Do you think that it’s a wanted thing to dissolve mass belief in the Western world to get rid of another thing that could bond people in numbers that are concerning to the powers that be?

Probably worded that horrendously but i’ve been trying to talk to my pals about it but they don’t really have opinions except for saying “religion is a joke, people who believe a magic man made everything are stupid” It’s not relevant if any of it is true imo when i see religious people having higher standards of the way people should be.

Speaking for US only- is it possible that Americans are so obese bc we have given up, or worked very hard to reduce other drugs? Like smoking is way down and drinking is way down, and most adults aren’t using drugs- is it just swapping one vice for another? Like from generation to generation (previous generations smoking vs current generations eating? )

Related note- the gov and such has worked hard to curb smoking and alcohol use by saying smoking kills etc, ie stating the exact thing they way you to stay away from. 
Whereas when speaking of obesity the message is always “obesity is bad for you”(the result) vs “stop over feeding yourself”(the action) - flipping back to the smoking example, that would have been like the ads saying lung cancer kills ( and not linking it to smoking) …..

 This part I know is possible.
 Here is the part I need help with (if it's even possible to begin with)
I want to be able to control what players hear and don't hear. For example:
 the players enter some ruins and they all roll perception. Some of the players roll high enough to hear something that the other players don't hear. I could play the audio, speak, or whatever, and only the players who are supposed to hear it will hear it. Nobody knows what was needed to be rolled in order to hear this, therefore, none of players knows that another player heard something that they didn't, likewise, the players who did hear something wouldn't know the other players didn't hear it. 
I know you can mute people, but that would shut off all audio, and they know something is up, so I would need to be able to do this without muting players. Is this even possible to achieve, and if so,  how?",NoStupidQuestions,1

This afternoon at 3:09 PM, my doorbell rang. Soon after, I saw a teenager absolutely booking it away from my house. Playing ding dong ditch. No big deal, we were all kids once.

As it happens though, I recently had a camera installed by my front door, which allows playback within the past 24 hours. On a whim, and mostly in the interest of testing out my new camera system, I decide to pull up the video of the kid ringing my doorbell. Here’s where it gets weird though.

I know for a FACT the time it happened. I also know the camera’s clock is set correctly. But I watched the entirety of 3:09, and there’s nothing. No one comes up to ring the bell. I check 3:08 and 3:10, on the off chance the clock is slightly off, but of course it’s not, and I find nothing. That’s when I notice something.

At precisely 3:09:13, the camera feed freezes. The clock stops, everything stops moving. A short while later at 3:09:25, it resumes and plays normally. The only possibility is that this kid ding dong ditched my house during this 12 second window.

There were children playing, and people drinking beers. The band played for about 45 minutes. I was seated on the sidewalk the whole time, leaning against the base of a sculpture. There were a few women dancing ten feet away, enjoying the band.

About forty minutes in, this woman (65? 70?) who'd been dancing the whole time turned around, made eye contact with me and walked over. I thought she was going to ask if I'd watch her purse. She sat down next to me, her shoulder right up against mine, and makes a comment about the music. We both sit there for a few minutes, enjoying the music, shoulders touching. She makes a little conversation, putting her hand on my arm. Offers me a sip of her beer (I declined). The band finishes, and is going to do an encore. She hopes they play Ripple. I say no way, Ripple isn't an encore song. They start to play. She stands up and dances a bit. I get up and walk away.

Nice guy, taught me to do the hoop and stick game. And when I was a kid the future seemed interesting. Not nice, necessarily, we were definitely expecting some sort of holocaust, but interesting! For the purposes of this rant I’ll focus on sports. 

I used to love the DC comic Strange Sports Stories. Whether it was playing hockey against a vengeful ghost, tennis with a live grenade or pole vaulting through time, it was awesome. I also loved the game parts of Rollerball, in the way only a bloodthirsty kid who doesn’t care about social commentary can. And who didn’t enjoy watching the Harlem Globetrotters finally figure out how to beat those pesky robots?

I’m not saying that’s what i expected the future of sports to look like, but i thought new sports would be exciting at least. Instead we’ve got the dystopia future where corporations and billionaires are running everything into the ground, but instead of futuristic sports they’ve apparently decided to replace horseshoes with cornhole and something called ladderball, as if children flinging rusty hunks of iron at each other is a bad thing.  And we’ve got the wealth inequality and environmental destruction of Rollerball but Pamela Hensley is nowhere to be found and i can’t sit in a packed arena chanting “Jonathan! Jonathan!”

What prompted this post was the renovations my town has been doing to a park near my house. I thought they might be putting in a court for tennis or maybe basketball, but apparently they decided to put in two pickleball courts. And apparently it’s the fastest growing sport in America?

So there’s my question - when and why did the future of sports veer away from Rollerball and towards Wiffle-Tennis?

And another question while I’m here - why is it called Pickleball? Does it even involve vinegar?",NoStupidQuestions,1

Im a guy in my mid 20s. Back in high school I was a sex machine. I got head a lot and had sex at a very early age. Super early bloomer. Anyways, post high school everything changed. I never got a girlfriend again, and at best all I ever got was talking stages with women. Not for lack of trying. Since highschool I have tried with all my might to have any sort of girlfriend, and it has just never worked out. Friend zoning, ghosting, all of it has happened to me. All of it except for it working out.

I’m not ugly. I’ve been called attractive a lot. I have great hair, a nice smile. I’m not rich. I’m poor. But I know that rarely matters, just again giving more detail. I don’t live with my parents. I am really creative and have made some impressive creative achievements. I like to consider myself as empathetic and motivated. I constantly spend hours daily thinking on how to better myself. I work out. What I’m trying to say is I think I’d fit the idea of a catch to some people. 

Despite all of this, I am invisible to women. Dating apps don’t work for me. Going to clubs with my friends doesn’t work either. My friends (who I will add are on the same level of good looking as me if not below; I know thats a scummy thing to say but I’m just trying to paint a picture of my confusion. They’re great people. I am shorter than all of them. I’m a short guy. But I’ve seen guys shorter than me get laid.) will get all the attention while I’m approaching women only for them to walk away when I do or act like I’m an annoyance on their day. Which fine yeah they don’t owe me anything but what is driving me crazy is just that I don’t get why thats what happens. I like to find solutions to problems. I like to improve. And yet I can never fix this issue in my life. 

I will add I am mentally ill. I have been hospitalized before unfortunately. I go to therapy. I suffer from some diagnosed illnesses. Nothing reality distorting. Just depression adhd etc.

I hear all kinds of things from friends. “You overthink too much” or “you have to work on your self esteem” or whatever. That’s cool man but I try to adapt myself everytime I hear these things. Try to fix them. I listen to advice. I try to do different things. I try to fix my problems. None of it has helped.

So what is it? What is my issue? When will this nightmare end? Sometimes I joke that the universe has this rule where it has forbidden me to find a hook-up or a relationship or marriage or whatever. Maybe as karma or a joke. I don’t know. Nothing else makes sense. I can’t find an answer. I just feel like I’d save myself so much mental pain if I accepted being single as my fate. Its like having this hope that theres an answer out there is what causes the pain. If I just stopped hoping and accepted defeat then I’d stop being let down or caring. I want to stop. But my friends don’t let me. They say one day it will happen. That I’m such a doomer or pessimist. But I don’t see it that way. All evidence points to the contrary. Years of rejection. It won’t stop. I don’t get it. It gets to the point with my friends where I feel like they just keep telling me to keep going because it makes them laugh to see me continue to try. Like a running joke.

Joe has been working there for about a year. Is friendly with people around them but is not nearly as well acquainted with the boss.

Right hand (John) was not explicitly caught drinking but a strong smell of spirits was smelt as they were walking by, being the only other person in the office - as well as being every now and then quite difficult to understand, leads to believe they might be drinking at work. John exhibits on and off slurred speech and is difficult to understand, some days he speaks perfectly fine. Joe is not a native english speaker and was quicker to blame themselves for poor understanding.

*What should happen now*

I believe something like this should be reported to the Boss. Not in any malicious way, no harm has been done and it is safe to assume that this is not having an impact on John's work.
I look at this situation from the point of view of the Boss. I would like to know information like this, no matter how likely it is to be true. I would also gain respect for Joe, of course if they were to handle this tastefully.

Joe believes that this is sticking your nose into someone's else's business. They are not friendly with the boss, they find it unlikely that the Boss would not know of something like this, they work closely together and if it was a big issue it would have been known by now.

I would also like to clear up that i can't paint the full picture of how uncomfortable a situation like this would be for Joe and so I can't name any other tangible reasons to support Joe's side because there are a lot of unspoken emotions at play.

I started going to driving school for B category last week. It was absolute hell. I am stuck on couple things that i don't understand and no matter how much i re-read all we wrote i still can't understand it properly nor remember it. I also get headaches a lot it's literally only when I'm there. We usually are there for like 2h 35min or like 3h 30min. 

I feel so fucking stupid. I'm the only girl there, there's like 5-6 of us. I feel like I'm the only one who understands nothing. When we practice answering questions i always stay silent when answers are revealed because i realize how many mistakes i actually make and its mostly the ones others got correct. Last time i didn't even bother reading nor understanding much i hated it and felt so low. Few times the instructor (also a woman) said like ""this is harder for us girls"" or ""especially girls need to be careful"" it's like i don't care but it's humiliating why am i the only one that has to be especially careful when driving behind trucks or going around cars? 

Also when they talk about like car brands and types idk i just don't understand anything and everyone else does like i can tell you what color it is or if it's passat or citroen but that's it. Add some numbers or letters or other words? Goodbye. It's so embarrassing. 

I don't know why it's taking such a toll on me tbh it's not that deep but it is and I'm paying money for it i don't want to fail and lose it all but it's so hard i hate it. 

I genuinely don't know what to do or how to get better. I'm definitely not gonna tell if I'm wrong because I'm introverted and shy so hell no but I'm at a loss. 

What am i supposed to do? I literally have only 1 day to learn what we did in 6. Ig my best way of learning is basically re-writing everything we wrote till now but idk if i should write in a new notebook where i understand it better (i used one where i wrote it all shitty cus it was just for the beginning but i had not time to re-write) or should i after every lesson write it on my computer and print it out? Maybe i will have easier access and it'll be easier to read? Or to just use a notebook? How to even practice all this properly?

I work once a week for a public university's law school and work 6+ hours.

As far as I'm aware, in the state of California we have the right to a 10 minute rest break and a 30 minute lunch break. My employer does not offer us a lunch break and has us work straight through, they then ask us to falsify our timesheets by adding in an hour lunch break and putting in an extra hour of work to make up for that hour of pay.

They also ask us to turn in our timesheets before we work and often ask us to log the hours 7-12..  our program always goes til 1 or later, however the official hours are to 12. They ask us to change our timesheets after the fact which is a long process (I'm assuming to delay payday)... I don't do this, I just wait and log my time after work is over.

It's a teaching job with highschoolers. They allow us to work before we have had the livescan (fingerprint scan/background check and confirmation of eligibility to work in the US) which I also believe is illegal.

We also had an incident last year with one of our co-workers talking inappropriately with a highschooler. They did nothing about the situation. It happened again and they lied multiple times saying they did something, changing the story to ""we didn't know"", ""we did something just no one told you"", ""we didn't do something the first time but the second time we did"".

It’s really just annoying because although i don’t rely on these substances for anything it’s kinda annoying how i can’t use a quick energy boost for coffee when i need it and can’t enjoy drinking when i wanna take a break and have a good time. For the time being I am going to be not drinking both of these drinks simply because they serve no use. Does anybody know whats going on?",NoStupidQuestions,1
656,848,1697317418.0,Why have I very suddenly lost all motivation/interest/energy? What's wrong with me?,"I (22) have never had a history of depression or anything, and have pretty much always been energetic and mtoviated and generally happy. Nothing bad has happened really, but I feel so, so sad (over nothing?) and see everything cynically.

  
Over the course of the last week I have very quickly lost all my motivation. I don't wanna get out of bed for anything. Nothing sounds good to me anymore. All the hobbies I was addicted to seem pointless. I used to LOVE my job now I'm about to resign because it seems stupid and I don't want to leave the house.   


All I feel like I can do is lay on the floor/bed and cry. But I'm crying without a reason, it feels so strange. Sometimes I'll watch one specific series, which makes me feel less sad while I'm watching it, but anything feels like a waste. I feel so cynical. Like it's taken me all day to write this post, I have no energy and feel like doing it is almost pointless.   


And I can't really remember anything that's happening. Like yesterday feels like a dream.

Can depression just come on suddenly like that? And without a reason? (If yeah, what should I do? I can't afford therapy or anything like that, have crap insurance.)

Or could I be sick? Is it just a rough cycle that I'll come out of? I've never felt so low in my life

The whole memory of getting the tattoo is really special to me (stick n poke in a punk rock trailer in the desert in the rain with new sweet friends and a budding love story - with someone who ended up treating me as bad as it gets without killing me, but I still endear the beginning stages of that adventure). It’s a symbol of survival and also how I claimed my own power when I entered that time, and also when I walked away. However, no one in my family or friends likes it. I honestly feel insecure about it. If it were surrounded by other tattoos I wouldn’t, but it’s all by itself on my arm. Also, it’s not the arm I wish it were on. The dislike for the tattoo is palpable from my family. I know how it sounds to say all this and that many folks would tell me that it’s my body and to keep it if I like it, but my truest friends feel sad when they see it, albeit confused (and that’s ok). I hope I see the artist again because we’re friends now although in different places, and I worry how she would feel, or rather, how I feel about removing it. The artist did a good job and she did what I asked her to. I just don’t like where I chose to have the tattoo nor it’s expression (a possum with its mouth open - I thought it would b fierce but it just reminds me of pain). Emotionally, I’m attached to it when I’m by myself and I gaze at it. In public sometimes I get self conscious of it, however. Has anyone else experienced similar feelings regarding a tattoo? What did you do? I’ve done two rounds of laser removal so far and I booked my appointment for the third. I don’t want to sell out my integrity, but I also feel that it affects the way I carry myself around others, so that’s affecting my integrity in an other way. I’m a violinist and training as a sound healer, so it might be in my best interest to have nothing on my arms. So, if you’re reading this, do I sound more like I’m wanting to keep it or remove it?

What ingredient(s) should I shop for in the future that's in the 'good' wash or avoid that's in the 'bad' wash?


I usually use Dove ""Cucumber and Green Tea"" body wash, but when it was out of stock at my store the other month I had to substitute with Dove ""Sensitive Skin hypoallergenic"". The cucumber one clings to my skin long enough in the shower for me to squirt with one hand and then lather on my skin with the other hand (I don't use a loofah or washcloth, though maybe I should. that's outside the scope of this question tho). Or long enough to start lathering, realize I forgot to brace my leg on the edge of the tub, move my leg up, and then continue lathering.

But the sensitive skin one sometimes slides right off my body in that split second right after I've squirted it?? So I've had to start carefully cupping each squirt and start lathering it in the palm of my hand immediately, otherwise the glob of it often drop onto the tub floor and go to waste. It also tends more toward staying in the original squirts/globs and needs more force for me to work it into my skin when I *do* catch runaways in time.


I'm assuming one of the culprit ingredients is gonna be well-known-ish, but when I Google for the differences intra-body-wash all I get are results about the differences between bar soap and body wash 🤦‍♂️. I would maybe guess glycerine, but that's present in both formulations. So maybe soybean oil?? The non-overlapping ingredients are:

Cucumber (easy to lather):

- sodium methyl lauroyl taurate
- sodium benzoate
- hydrogenated vegetable glycerides
- glyceryl stearate
- glycol distearate
- hydroxystearic acid
- cucumis sativus (cucumber) juice
- camellia sinensis leaf extract
- carrageenan
- cyamopsis tetragonoloba (guar) gum
- sodium gluconate
- alpha-isomethyl ionone
- hexyl cinnamal
- limonene
- linalool

Sensitive (harder to lather):

- sodium hydroxypropyl starch phosphate
- sodium lauroyl glycinate
- hydrogenated soybean oil
- glycine soja (soybean) oil
- guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride
- bht
- tetrasodium edta

We know that some individuals can only receive LASIK or PRK once in their lifetime, while others may be eligible for multiple surgeries. 

So, why isn't the surgery performed on the 15-year-old to potentially reduce their prescription back to 0? Then, when they're 19, it might not be as high as 5, possibly a 3 or less.

I'm in a friend group irl, and we have a WhatsApp and discord group where we all are and chat when we aren't around, and in both of them one of the friends is the leader (let's call the leader friend Adam.). I suggested earlier that I could make the discord server but Adam said that I can that they need to do that to be the admin. 
And with the WhatsApp group we all had admin before but then Adam took the admin privileges away from everyone else but them, leaving Adam in control. 
Then he set up a ranking system for us, (the friends in the group, including me) where you start with 100 points and you lose points if you do something Adam doesn't like, and you gain points if you do something good. It's like he's a dictator or something.
I've lost quite a few points just for having different opinions than Adam as have the other friends too, and it kind of hurts my feelings. 
The other friends in the group think Adam is very nice and kind but the whole ranking system argues with that... It's like we have to please Adam only and we are his slaves.

Everyone has their own opinion on remakes, this isn't that debate, but there are animated films that are widely and wildly requested to be remade (even in live action) but because the original film ""flopped"" it's not a priority, if it's on the radar at all. My mental rabbit whole dug itself deeper when I realized that an entire industry is compromised of basically 40+ aged men and is trying to direct you to what they think is what. We've had this weird trend of a bunch of old men complaining that the avengers aren't the godfather, animation isn't ""cinema"" kind of thing and I feel like it's going to negatively influence today's cult classics going forward. 

My anecdotal example is going to be Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001). It's a huge fan favorite, and it had less than stellar reception on release and is considered a ""flop"". Despite some pretty vocal support, it doesn't appear to be on anyone's radar at all in terms of remakes or continuation. It came out next to Fellowship of the Ring, Jurassic park 3, and Planet of the Apes on the same year that the towers fell. Of course a children's movie is going to perform poorly, but that shouldn't be what's reflective of its modern viability.

If this seems like a bit of a long-winded question, I apologize. I'm just exhausted with the constant upstream struggle.

Career wise, I have little hope of staying in the same field. I work as a deputy coroner, have a master's degree in forensic medicine, and am working on a doctorate in forensic science, which are extremely niche credentials that only really apply within the American medicolegal death investigation or crime scene work, which I'm sure are different elsewhere. Despite having a very interesting day job, I barely make enough to survive even extremely frugally. Inflation has made my $60k/yr position feel like a $30k job, which is where I was for most of my adult life despite ""succeeding"" in school (which everybody told me was a ticket to success). Full tuition academic undergrad scholarship, 4.0GPA from high school to grad school, all the bullshit effort that goes into trying to ""follow your heart"" and make a career, and today I had to make a trip to the pawn shop and the plasma center just to make it to payday.

I don't know how someone gets out of this. I don't know whether it's the country or the whole world. I just want to get off the low part of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and I don't know how. In my escapist mind I envision moving somewhere else with better healthcare, a lower cost of living, where people actually give a shit about each other instead of just chasing a dollar so they can get a bigger truck so they can get more dollars so they can get a bigger truck.

And even if a place like that exists - somewhere I can thrive even on a single room with a cot - I can't imagine they'd want some random American with skills only in an extremely niche and underpaid field. We're the laughing stock of the rest of the world.

Having become disabled with a connective tissue disorder at a similar age to when you lost your sight I find immeasurable hope and comfort in the Marvel Netflix show, Daredevil, you consulted on. I have allowed it’s impact, and subsequently yours, to shape and hold value in my life especially in how I view my own strengths and limitations. In 2020 Marvel introduced a fan-made disabled character Charolette Webber AKA Sun-Spider with Into The Spiderverse. She is queer and has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, the first portrayal I have seen of my connective tissue disorder, as well as in combination with my orientation, in mainstream media. I suspect that audiences may have their first learning experience with the condition from this character. As I have encountered many health professionals that have not been made aware of it’s existence despite decades of experience. Although there are a dozen other characters with disabilities or mobility aids, I felt with the resurgence of Daredevil’s popularity due its emotionally provocative accuracy that Sun-Spider was able to be brought into the spotlight were representation is desperately needed. ***Where along your path did you become aware that your impact would have far-reaching implications for a broader perspective of disabled and minority storytelling?***",NoStupidQuestions,1

A lot of those stories seam to center around guests wearing white dresses, and I completely understand why that's a no go. However, I recently came across a story where ab afab NB person who self described as androgynous wore a dark suit including a jacket with a white blouse and getting shit from others for it. I was massively confused, since men wear white shirts at weddings all the time and it's not a big deal.

So I started wondering, how much white do you think is acceptable as a guest? My sister wore a white belt with her dress at my dad's second wedding (she was 20 at the time, so not a little girl) and nobody commented, though she did get approval from both my dad and our stepmom first. Stepmom's sister wore a dress with tiny white and blue flower embroidery on the bodice, and that didn't raise a brow either. When I went to a friend's wedding I was torn between 2 dresses, one that was green with black lace and one that was dark blue lace bodice with a white modesty layer underneath. Even though the blue lace was very dense and the whit was only noticeable up close I wasn't sure if it would be ok and opted for the green one.

He was there for a few night in the same spot and I wasn't sure if he had moved since he got there.  Well 2 nights ago, it was absolutely pouring rain and 50 degrees out.  Water was running over the little guy like a waterfall and naturally I felt bad for him, so I put on gloves and picked him off the wall and took him inside to dry him off.  He was mad at first, but when I started to dry him off with a small towel, he calmed down.  I don't really have any accommodations for a bat, so I turned off a lamp and hung him up in the lamp shade for him to dry the rest of the way off.  Then I turned off the rest of the lights and went to bed.

The following morning, he was still hanging inside the lamp shade, and before work I cracked open the window hoping he would find his way out.  I returned home 12 hours later and I heard music playing and saw the lights on.  I walked in and there were hundreds of bats having a party.  There were beer cans and pizza boxes everywhere and the place was just trashed.  I asked all the bats to leave immediately, but they all laughed and called me hurtful names.  The neighbors were pissed and thought I was crazy when I explained the situation, so I told them to go take a look for themselves.  The neighbors were astonished, but then also tried to get the bats to leave with no success, the bats even made the animal loving girl cry with their insults.

Eventually the bats turned off the music once they all were tired out, but started up again the next night.  I went over to the breaker panel and turned off the one to the living room, then closed and locked the door so they couldn't get in.  All the bats immediately became pissed and demanded I turn the power back on, but I refused.  I locked myself in my room hoping they would leave eventually, but they kept getting increasingly mad.  I heard them breaking a lot of my stuff and they have started threatening violence.  I'm stuck in my room at the moment, and I'm positive the bats can't get in, as I'm sure they're much too small to operate a door handle, but it's locked anyway just in case.

He is speaking on her behalf when in the real time of the events which he is narrating in present tense he has had no time to speak to her making his views on how she feels biased conjecture.

The protagonist is assuming a lot of info without consulting her view.

My question is, if an eye pops out and it's fully connect, no further damage has happened from the trauma, and it can be popped back in by a doctor, are we able to see from that eye as its out of the socket?

If so what effects them?,"In my experience as a musician I would assume that every whip crack would be at least slightly different, due to rigidity, length, and/or speed, but in my very limited experience with whips, they all sound the same to me. I'm largely basing my possibilities on the guitar because it's what I have the most experience with.

Rigidity I think would have the largest effect, and more rigid whips would have a deeper tone similar to how thicker strings at the same tension as thinner strings have wildly different frequencies.

Length I think would be the next largest effect. If rigidity doesn't matter at all, then making a string longer without changing the tension would make the string higher pitched.

Speed I think would play the smallest part in any change, but with guitars specifically picking too hard can cause a string to sound higher than what it's tuned.

Expanding slightly on this, do whips have multiple harmonics in one crack?",NoStupidQuestions,1

But when I get the cheaper one I sometimes buy my friend one as well, and I also buy a bunch of sweets that he has some of most of the time.

The reason why is because he doesn’t have a job or much money. Doesn’t have a job because he’s not a citizen/have a work permit and even though he can find gigs, I understand the difficultly because I used to be a bum as well.

So for me $40 on him is one hour of work a month, but he doesn’t have a source of income.

Here’s the problem.
1. When he had money he was stingy towards tipping and sharing. The one thing he did for me years ago when I had no job (he got life insurance money back then) is take me on a trip and paid for everything except food. I see that as generosity but also that it was to his benefit because he wanted someone to come along.

I always grew up knowing it’s rude to interrupt people when they are engaging in a conversation and just wait til they’re done or at least say excuse me before interrupting. Anyways at my job the shifts I work I’m either by myself or with another person, it’s rare there are 3 people assigned to the same area on the same shift. Anyways usually the next shifts will have a 15 minute overlap and our replacements will clock in and come to their assigned area and chop it up with the people clocking out soon. To be clear I have no problem with that and there are (very) few coworkers that actually just say hi and wait for an opening in the conversation to speak, but I hate with every fiber in my being when I’m having a full on conversation with my coworker and the next shift replacements will come say hi but not only that, but will exclude me and will ask only my coworker something pertaining to them and just start talking about that as if they didn’t see us already talking about something.

195,254,1697432791.0,Friend serving food on sex party - I am a bit concerned,"I am going to be quite brief as the question is real simple.

&#x200B;

So, for some time, my friend (F, mid thirties, no, not the same person) has been running some errands for one lady of the night here in the area. My friend is unemployed, toggles 4 day-jobs and lives like a student, struggling to complete her university thesis and be on her merry way.

&#x200B;

However, this particular job seem to be rather lucrative (hourly pay is great, although she works only couple of hours per week). We are talking ironing, cleaning... that sort of things.

&#x200B;

Now, since she developed really good relation with her employer, because she is literally a super person - caring, smart and GREAT looking, she eventually got an invitation to serve drinks and food on one sex party that is being organized soon.

&#x200B;

Now, since I have my fair share of life experience - it is my belief that this is recruiting.

&#x200B;

Question: Am I right? Is this recruiting? And what are some of the possible scenarios (just throw it at me, no matter how bad)? And, is there something to be done, should things take turn for the worse? Has anybody heard of or witnessed something similar? I mean, I know these are usually drug fueled parties, but... that only makes my assumptions worse. How often does catering personnel engage in activities? Are they considered participants as well? Or are they ""off limits""?

So... lay it on me. And please, keep it real. I know this might awake some fantasies, but the question here is potential rescue mission of a person I hold in high regard (and have some deep relationship with).",NoStupidQuestions,1

My partner is disabled, dealing with alot lately, so they dont have the strength or energy to be all lovey dovey. Even though I am worried and will do everything I can and know, to support them, there is always this overwhelming voice in my head, that just wants to be told I am good, I am loved, and compliments or interest.

Do you think using the sanitize setting on the dishwasher is necessary every time you do a load of dishes? Or do you just run the regular setting? Does a regular setting work well enough to get rid of bacteria etc if you leave dishes out for a week or 2 before washing them? Logically, I think the answer is yes but here for opinions, thoughts, reassurance. 
Edit: I actually use the heavy setting not normal setting. I assume with heavy setting- it uses higher temperature than normal

Same for clothes- the only reason I can think of to use it is for really soiled clothes. 

Thoughts? I am slightly OCD but I think using the sanitize setting every time is overkill and it takes so much longer. I do use a pre wash, main wash cascade pod and rinse aid.",NoStupidQuestions,1

Hi Reddit, I know the tittle is weird but I’m genuinely wondering if what I’m feeling is weird or wrong. So for some time now I (M22) have been thinking of buying a ps5, in the past I hadn’t bought one due to their high price. I began to save some money and nowadays I have the money to treat myself. Right now for some reason this console is in its all time low at my country, after doing the math I decided that I could buy it, all my friends have already upgraded and new games are already releasing only for new gen. I’ve felt like am lagging behind them when a new game we all want comes out and I’m the only one that can’t play. Today I went shopping and find it, I was about to pay, excited for the games and experiences I was about to encounter but suddenly I felt a wave of sadness. I remembered my old ps4 sitting on my desk at home. I decided to give it a second thought. I got home and turned it on, I hoped on some games and when I finished I looked at it and realize how much I love that console, it was the first console in which I played online and honestly thanks to it I was able to make friends back in school, all the experiences I had began flooding in. I know it’s hard for some to understand this feeling but I couldn’t imagine just disconnecting it, putting it in a box and just forgetting about it. I know everything has a cycle but I’m just feeling like I can’t end this one. So I know I will upgrade because life evolves and so does technology, I won’t be able to play with my friends and the new stories that come in the future but it just feels weird holding my controller for the last time after 8 years together. So Reddit am o wrong or weird for feeling like this? I just don’t know who to ask because I feel it’s such a weird thing what I’m going through.",NoStupidQuestions,1

I don’t even exaggerate these things as I have had someone turn left into my car for the sake of cutting me off when I had right of way, and they did not feel even a little bit of guilt. legally they were wrong on all accounts but still tried to argue the case? and if I didn’t act and swerve they would’ve driven straight into my body in the driver’s seat.

how does anyone not get fatigued over this? I dread jobs I’m applying to that are over 15 minutes away bc I cannot stand driving but the job market is dead where I live. everything is at least 10-15 minutes away so I’ve slowly stopped going shopping, running errands, getting food, everything, bc driving makes me so sick. I don’t even make any remote detours for fun bc it means more driving. i wish I could walk or bike without risk of dying on a massive highway without an airbag.

there’s a great potential opportunity but it requires half an hour each way for just 4 hours of work and barely above minimum wage. it’s an extra 5 hours per week to being in fight or flight which is something I’ve been working to get out of but I have to build my resume.

245,321,1697427787.0,How does foreign aid works?,"The U.S has given about 3.75 Trillion Dollars in foreign aid since the end of WW2. This number is huge but it's still less than 1 percent  of the federal budget. For context, this is less than the amount the U.S spent (over 4.2 trillion), helping its own citizens, part of it in the form of financial in a much much shorter period of time during the pandemic stimulus packages. Another way to understand this amount, is compared to the U.S national debt being over 33 trillion dollars. But also, this isn't pennies, for example, the U.S is giving Ukraine over 47% of the aid it is receiving, and the other 53% is a collision of the EU and other countries.

 (Also, just how massive is the U.S?)  


I understand this in comparing my own circumstances, in which my ""foreign debt"" is my vehicle and mortgage loan, a huge debt, and yet, I still come to make payments monthly, while being able to allocate about 1,000.00 a year for charity, after all my expenses, and putting money towards saving. If I bankrupt one day, it won't be because that extra 1k a year I donated, nor it will make a big different in prosperity. All good so far and I don't have any concerns or opinions against U.S giving foreign aid.

But how come the U.S gives money to countries, considered allies and also some, otherwise, consider hostile? I don't want to make this about politics and I'm not going to mention U.S benefactors by country but said list, seems to include nations hostile to each other or even the U.S

This is like if I donated money to the humane society and at the same time some Non-profit organization interested in the suffering of animals, the humane society strives to help

I try to rationalize it as just ""foreign policy and influence"" but then again, some of this aid seems to be going to nations which have no interest in alliance with the U.S politically or culturally. Some would rejoice in the end of the U.S.

What's the criteria then? Because, if it was to influence, wouldn't the most important factor in regards to influence, be  that in order to receive U.S financial help, first establish a Pro-U.S government, adhere to U.S/Western democratic values, open trade relationships...etc

I just am confused. I'm not pro or anti anything. I just am hoping to get better understanding on this subject. Also some of this otherwise hostile nations don't even have oil to claim it is because of the oil.

If you wanted just chicken breasts, you had to ask the butcher for them and he'd roll his eyes at you. Sometimes on special you might find a pack of just thighs or just drumsticks, but it was not a regular item they kept in the cooler. Wings would be on a freezer shelf somewhere along with the ""weird"" meats like tripe or pigs' feet or beef tongue. (We used to buy them to go crabbing).

Nowadays when you buy chicken, it comes in a pack of thighs, or a pack of breasts or a pack of drumsticks. All the same part. Packs with all the different parts are still around sometimes, but they've gotten pretty rare.

I 26f and my partner 28 M have been dating since I was 13 years old . He is my first boyfriend, I have lost my virginity with him and experienced all the stuff you would in a relationship, with him only. 
I have no comparison as I've never been in a relationship with anyone else but I feel like he is just not sexually attracted to me anymore . 

We have been through alot in the 13 years however we have always maintained a strong relationship.  We do everything together and have been renting a house together for the past 6 years. We share our Bill's equally and never fight about money. 

Up until about 1 year ago we have always had a healthy sexual relationship . However lately I found we barely have sex anymore and I feel like we are too young to start living like the old married couple if you know what I mean. I feel like I'm the only one initiating interest all the time but I want my man to want me on his own initiative. 

Now my partner is a very anxious person who had issues with depression and has started taking antidepressants about a year ago as well. I wonder do they have this impact on his sex drive . He is better now tough and on the way to stop taking his meds as his doctor is reducing his dosage .  I understand that he is always worried about what could go wrong in our lifes but I'm starting to feel confused at what he is actually feeling for me. 

I get so little attention from him romantically that I started to fantasize about other men and this is worrying me . 

I get more attention from strangers on the street or my male co workers and that is probably starting to mess with my head . 

I'm considering confronting him about this and asking if he is with me because he loves me or he is just used to me. We are saving for a house together and all these other commitments that are life long but if we won't be able to stay in a relationship this is all pointless.

Granted, I have debts I'm trying to clear and I don't have to pay my parents too much but I feel completely stuck - i am in a better position with the debts, its manageable and a hell of a lot better than it used to be.

I want my own place, hell I even had my own place at one point but costings just don't work out.

For context:

I'm 22
I earn roughly £1600-£1800 a month, overtime dependant really.
I pay £1200 every four months for rent.

Due to having a substantial amount of money stolen from me, I'm paying upwards of £400 per month on debts, across multiple creditors and family lending me money etc.

I pay 300-400£ in bills each month.

And then I allow myself £200 leisure each month. Granted, I'm not necessarily struggling to get by, I know I'm relatively lucky in that sense but I cannot figure out a reasonable way to save up.

Even with renting, in my area id be looking at a minimum of £1000-1200 a month, unless I go down a council house route.

Adding in the debts, I immediately can't afford it. Then there's the part for the deposit.

The other side is no matter what, I always forget about some payments I have to make and end the month on practically nothing.

He said it was $50 for the folder where he had 200 videos. I ended up buying what I thought was that folder through a link he sent using unlockt.me. It ended up being only a single video of not even what I asked. I messaged him on Twitter again trying to figure out why the folder wasn't in the link he sent and he promptly blocked me after my message. I have never used unlockt.me so I was worried about my account safety. I called my bank and asked them to deactivate my card and they're going to send me another in the mail. I also told them why I was asking for it and they offered for me to file a charge dispute and as long as I have recipts I should be able to get compensated. The problem is all I have is the direct message information. I am worried the diapute will be ruled againat me but also that my standing with my bank will deteriorate tremendously due to the nature of my issue and my lack of what I think is sufficient evidence. Should I call my bank and cancel the dispute or go through with it? This is my first time ever and I would rather just lose the money if I might get in bigger trouble.,NoStupidQuestions,1
289,371,1697423794.0,How can I (24M) know for sure that my best friend (23F) doesn't hate me?,"We've been friends for 11 years and to be honest, I don't really have a reason to think she does. But she's really important to me and I really enjoy her company. Every activity is more fun with her presence. But I'm always paranoid that I'll do or say something wrong or she'll get tired of me or something.

Like yesterday we spent 17 hours straight together (10am to 3am) and I do realize that most people wouldn't do that if they didn't want to. But also, part of me is worried that I overstayed my welcome and she didn't want to say anything to spare my feelings. I'd hope that she'd be comfortable enough to tell me she's ready to call the day off and I always tell her she can kick me out whenever.

And last night, at like 2am she was like ""What should we do now? Wanna play a board game?"" which I feel like she wouldn't do if she didn't want me there? But I also texted her today to tell her I had fun and thank her for driving me home and she didn't respond but she's been a bad texter for as long as I've known her and apparently is that way with everyone.

I guess asking her directly would work but I don't want to sound insecure and I'm also worried that she'd tell me that she doesn't mind my company even if it does bother her in order to spare my feelings.

I know I'm probably overthinking it. I'm just trying to figure out how to be assured that she enjoys my company about as much I enjoy hers.",NoStupidQuestions,1

So basically, you know how there are people with no arms or with no legs?

In a hospital, you basically cut off a person's hands and legs in a professional or surgical way.

Once that person has no legs and hands, you make them blind, and you make them unable to speak (like being mute)

So you get a person with no legs and no hands who can't see and can't talk.

Now for the special part, you connect them to infusion, feeding and nurturing them.

And that's it. That person can feel, breathe and hear, but they can't move, die, communicate or do anything.

I eat healthy and stay in suggested calories but really struggle to get to a slim weight. Are slim people lying about how much they eat and it’s an unspoken rule to eat a smaller amount or are they just blessed with a great metabolism?


edits:

I don’t drink my calories! I’m not a fan of really sugary drinks/coffee, even when I was at my biggest weight my coffee was black and I only really drink water.  

In terms of being active, I’ve walked 10,000 steps a day for the last few years. It was a promise I made to myself to keep it up and it’s something that I very rarely don’t do.

The most common answer seems to be that fat people are lying to themselves which I believe somewhat to be true, I definitely was lying to myself at my biggest or maybe not even lying, just not being fully aware but I also do truly believe currently I’m eating healthy and not lying to myself. I’ve lost a really decent amount of weight in the past few years, I don’t lie to myself about how much I eat and in the last couple of months it’s just stalled. I’ve realised most people in the comments are US based so I’ll give both sizes I was always a uk size 18/20 or US size 14/16 and now I’m a UK size 14/16 or US size 10/12. I’m starting to wonder if my body is just incapable of being a smaller size. 

The main reason I ask this question is because for me to lower my currently calories I think the average calorie calculator online would deem it as “unhealthy” and too little. So I’m wondering if it’s common for people to just go into those “unhealthy” small amount of calories to lose weight but it’s not really discussed.",NoStupidQuestions,1

I have completely redone my resume countless times, spoken with career coaches and followed their advice, redone my LinkedIn entirely, sent follow up messages, emails, watched YouTube videos, everything. I truly am just at a loss for what it is I’m supposed to do to land a decent job. I have experience and about 25 different copies of my resume and a portfolio with work examples. If anyone would be willing to take a look at my assets and tell me what I could be doing wrong I would be incredibly grateful. Not trying to throw a pity party, I am just truly not sure what else I can do to move this along and would genuinely appreciate your help more than I can tell you.

347,447,1697419416.0,Would you rather say a lie or tell the truth when either way your an ahole,I just broke off a nearly 15 year friendship with a person I really never felt like I wanted as a friend. I know I'm an ahole. She always made everything about her. It was always a competion. She'd point out when I was off key. We had to listen to her music. She'd constantly compare our lives. We are both adopted but our adoption stories are very diffrent. She'd tell me that my past wasn't bad because others made it seem like theirs was worse. There was a bit of a delusion problem that even she admitted to. Like she wants to believe she invented words when she obviously didnt. For a long time I tried to brush it off. I tried to pretend it didn't bother me. I knew some of it went back to her disability and how her parents chose to raise her because of it. And she also grew up with a lot of privileges that cause her to throw literal tantrums when things dont go her way. We did have good times together. And she was there when nobody else had time to hang out.  But recent events in our friend group just made it hard for me to tolerate how we exist together. I'm absolutely no angel  and have a lot of baggage I've been working on for years. One of which is avoiding hurt feelings at all cost. I told her based off recent events that I felt like we were drifting apart due to her not reaching out when a mutual friend publicly asked her to. And she got defensive like she usually does and brough up how several months ago i stoped answering phone calls. To be fair yah i did but she knew it was because i work a horrible job with no ac and was exhausted. I had apologized and i had my friends add her to our dnd group. Huge mistake they did not like her. I now i can't take back what i said. It's already done. But would you have told her the truth in hopes she would change?

i like the idea of taking some time for my birthday, im in my 30s and never really had good birthdays growing up due to being poor and having bad friendships/relationships - im trying to correct this and “treat myself“ as an adult, but trying to do anything in the time frame of my actual birthday is next to impossible due to my intolerance to heat.

my question is, how do i “change” my birthday? i know i cannot do this legally, and this is not something i feel i need to pursue anyway. but all my friends know my birthday, and i would feel very weird telling them i am switching it to something like my “anti-birthday”... how do i “change” it so that the time i personally decide to celebrate and recognize it is also celebrated and recognized by friends? i live abroad, away from my immediate family, which feels like it might make it easier - i dont have to attend anything organized w/o my consent by family - but still idk how to explain to friends; for example, that yes, they know my birthday is in august but suddenly i decided it is in february! how do i “transition” folks into a “new birthday” for myself??? or am i overcomplicating it?

I've been wondering why gathered end hammocks aren't more commonly used for sleeping for a long time. These hammocks offer several advantages:  
Cost-Effective: They are much cheaper traditional beds, I got my fav one for $39.  
Space Efficient: When not in use, they take up almost no space.  
Easy to Clean: They are machine-washable.  
Breathable: Their thin material is perfect for hot summer nights, turn a fan on and you get a breeze all around you.  
Versatile for All Seasons: They easily accommodate under quilts for warmth in the winter.  
Relaxing Sway: Gentle rocking can enhance sleep quality.  
Low Installation Cost: You can set them up in almost any room without a significant expense.  
What's your take on this? I can't see any downsides unless you're wanting to sleep with your partner that night, and some hammocks you can fit 2 people in kinda. Do you have any insights or experiences to share about using gathered end hammocks for sleeping?

A quick background about our relationship, we are from the middle east, therefore our religion and culture does not allow to go out on dates or have sex before marriage. We met on Instagram and started talking on the phone on daily basis and before we even get in a relationship we started sexting. The sexual attraction was always there from the beginning. Until finally he came to propose and we got engaged. In the beginning he was nervous even if we were alone in the car he hesitated to touch me. But when we were alone in my room its all normal and he gets more relaxed, so i thought maybe he cant do it in public (i mean show affection) not even a kiss. But when we got married and moved in together (in an apartment building behind his folks house that they built for their kids) he kept stopping me when i tried to touch him. And i am an attractive (26F) i get lucky once or twice a month. I thought its stress or he has a-lot on his mind. But this also happens when we go on vacations, we went to Italy and greece and we had sex once only. Its frustrating for me because i crave him so much.

Just recently i’ve talked it about it with him. And he told me that this is how he is and that his sexual drive is low. I tried to ask him few questions like why he doesn’t have a boner when he sees me naked? He said only animals have boners without foreplay ?!.. it gets worse whenever i ask a new question.

We met last month and got along really well our first day meeting. We exchanged numbers (for academic reasons since we’re in the same group) and she said we should go eat out together sometime. Anyways, I basically texted her id like to get to know her but if she’s seeing anyone I don’t wanna ruin that…. She didn’t respond to it and then she didn’t respond to me anymore after that.

After about one full week of no contact, she sends me a message saying how her mother came from Europe and is staying with her for two weeks and she hasn’t been on her phone that much. She added it had nothing to do with me (I asked her if I did something to be getting ignored). She then texts me asking if I have the book for our class and I said yes but she didn’t ask for it. So, 8 hours later I’m like ""do you want me to share it?"" And she responds one minute later saying ""I already found it finally hahaha thaaaanks"".

I then decide to ask her to study together tomorrow and she responds by saying ""yes we can !"" And we agreed to a time. The thing is, when we met today, she was so touchy. She touched everything from my notebook to my laptop and would lean in so close to me we were like face to face and were looking in each others eyes. Truly distracting especially for me. When I’d leave and come back she’d just stare at me and ask me where did I go etc. We talked about everything and our backgrounds. 

Our convo got so deep that she cut it off with a big smile and said ""we have to study"" (looked like she was having a playful tone while she said it almost like she likes the distraction). Long story short, I saw her Lock Screen when she received a text and there was a photo of her and some guy (girls only do this when they’re dating someone) and I instantly got turned off. We ended up taking the train home together and when I completed how she speaks three languages she looked at me deep in my eyes and didn’t say anything but just smiled. When she got off she turned around to wave at me.

I don’t know if she’s dating someone or if I even saw that was really her or her mother on her phone screen but I’m getting pretty paranoid. Advice ?",NoStupidQuestions,1

My practically would suggest if we're in a dying off as a species we do the best we can and make those who remain comfortable. Often stories make it a top priority for the species to survive. Why? I'm for protecting everyone who exists. But why does the species specifically need to survive.

An example that might help. At the climax of Interstellar, Dr. Brandt gets left alone, lonely distraught, overwhelmed, with ingredients to try to seed Earth-like life and humans on a new planet, far away. They believe this will never help anyone on Earth. (Ignore the magic ending and gravity flight. Pretend things had gone as they expected.) Why is it better to do that than to stay with loved ones and do the best you can with them? In the United States, I think we usually glorify fighting, winning, surviving. There's also the Hufflepuff virtue of being there to ""die with them."" To help and support even when you're no longer free of the mess.

437,563,1697412139.0,Am I the asshole for ghosting my friend after he friendzoned me?,"So I have a friend that is 2 years younger than me. I have known him since 2020/2019, (he is my mom's friend's son, and they visit like twice every year) but I did not become ""friends"" with him until 2022. 

I do not have many friends. I am friends with him and his sister, and that is it. I barely get any attention from guys, at all. Like I have never been asked out or crushed on. Guys do not approach me or look at me either.
 I started to develop feelings for my friend because he was the only person that would talk to me. However he has always liked my younger sister who is the same age as him, but I thought he might have been over the crush. (He had liked her since like 2020/2019).

We had a lot of fun when everytime he visited. When he was here, me, him and his sister would have play fights. We would play video games together, go outside together (the all 3 of us) and so on. And I remember specifically that 1 night only me and him stayed up till like 5 am and played video games together. I really started to like him. 

Whenever he was not here we would have a lot of contact online, like chat and play video games. Being the dumbass I am I overshared with him (like I always do with every person that just gives me a little bit of attention). I literally shared my whole backstory, like all my insecurities, weaknesses, strengths, goals in life etc without me knowing any of those things about him. And he comforted me. 

After a while I asked him if he still liked my sister, and he said yes. I asked him why he liked her and he said it was because he thought that she was really pretty and that he misses the close friendship they used to have. 
Then I asked him why he always spoke to me if it was my sister that he really liked, and he said ""because when I talk to you I feel like I am talking to a friend or bro, but when I walk to her it feels like my life depends on it"". 

To act like I did not have feelings for him I just said that I could help him get to know my sister. I suggested him and her going ice skating or playing something together. I also made a groupchat with him, her and me in it where I was supposed to help him impress her or get to know her. 
I am not a backstabbing person, so I kept my word and helped him, although it hurt.
I was so hurt by the fact that he liked my sister, that I cried for weeks.
 I tried to force myself to lose feelings for him, which worked. I managed. I did not want to try to make someone love me when their heart belonged to someone else. 

I started to slowly stop talking to him. He always messaged me and joined me in games, but I sent him more and more short responses. I started to ignore him. And eventually he stopped trying.

Now today him, his sister and his mom came to visit. They are staying for like 5 days,  and I did not greet him. I completely ignored him. I did not try to initiate conversation, have play fights or play games like we would usually do. I did not even look at him. However I did still spend time with his sister. I spoke to her, played with her, etc. 
I noticed that he looked at me sometimes, it seemed like he was kind of sad. (Not because he likes me in that way, but because he might feel left out or like he lost a friend which he looks upon like a ""big bro"" although I am a girl.)

He tried to sit besides his sister when me and her were talking, to include himself. But I pretended like he was not there. 
Then me and his sister play fighted, and he tried to include himself. He threw a pillow at me but I pretended like it did not happen and ignored him. 
Me and his sister tried to carry each other. When she tried to carry me, he asked what I weighed (just to start conversation I guess) and I did not look at him and just said ""62"". He did not try any further.

And when I used the computer and played a game but also had my YouTube music playlist out, he came up to me and watched what I was doing. He tried to talk to me and ask what I was doing, but I did not really respond. 

I encouraged my sister to go play video games with him, and she did. 

The whole reason I ghosted him is because he friendzoned me, and I do not want to catch feelings for him again and get hurt once again. And I knew that he liked my sister, so I would not try anymore to ""earn his heart"" when he likes my sister anyway, even though we were close friends and he barely knew her. 

I also do not want a bunch of male friends. I want a male friend and that male friend would be my future boyfriend/husband, but since I know I will not have that with him I do not want to remain friends with him for my own sanity and morals. 

I feel like I am being selfish and an asshole. I mean he does not know why I am doing this. He did not know that I liked him, and it is not like he did anything wrong. He is not in the wrong for not having feelings for me and friendzoning me. It is more like I do not want to get hurt again.

450,577,1697410934.0,Why do people hate tax season when it seems like you get money back?,"Maybe it's because I haven't made much so far. There seems to be a dread towards tax day.

I always feared taxed day growing up. My parents took my papers to a tax preparer and I was trained to do that growing up. Last year I made the most gross amount of money ever which was 31k. I also prepared my own taxes. It took 2-3 hours for my first time doing it which isn't horrible. Just one W2 and a school 1098-T. It sounds like I will be getting back 3,000. Which tells me would you be happy about tax day because you get money deposited back?

Next year, I will be doing maybe towards 100k but for 2024 it will be 102k.

Here's what I'm thinking:

A. people are complaining about handing papers to a tax guy and paying them, or complaining about the hours it takes them to do their own. They also have more stuff going on that takes longer.

B. Some people actually have to pay up more money instead of getting money back.",NoStupidQuestions,1

* Conversation is the main activity

* Accessibility and accommodation

* The regulars

    Third places harbor a number of regular people.
* A low profile

    Characteristically inviting and not some 'gentlemans club' exclusive feel.
* The mood is playful

I know for a fact they go to the local highschool and as much as I want to go there and inform the teachers about the incident, I know that there will be almost nothing done about it if I do.  The reason why I want to do this is because during my time in school I was always told that we represented the school outside of school hours.

\- apparently they also tried to break into someones house in my neighborhood as well

We'd been talking on and off for about a week and a half. They asked me to move our conversation to Line app. I said okay and then copied my Line link and sent it to them. They asked what the link was and I told them it was my Line profile link. They told me they weren't going to click on the link because they couldn't verify it. I do understand that. I don't click on random links my friends send me if there's no thumbnail, so I generally ask what it is, and then depending on their answer, click/delete the link. So this person I was talking to on Tinder refused to click on the link. They then sent me their ID. I haven't verified my age or service provider on on Line app, so the only way I can search for people is by profile link or QR code. I told the person I was talking to this. They asked me to add them by QR code, so I sent them my email address. They then started questioning me about my name. I gave them my real first name. In the end, this person refused to send me their QR code via email and we continued talking on the Tinder app per their request. They told me they had been swindled out of 650,000 dollars. Supposedly, someone contacted them and asked them to invest 100,000 in real estate and this person did it. In a subsequent email with this person who they gave 100,000 dollars to, the person sent my ""friend"" on Tinder a link. When my friend clicked on the link, somehow this person was able to get into my friends bank account and remove another 550,000 dollars without my friends knowledge. I asked my friend how on earth this happened and my friend said they didn't know. I was SHOCKED to say the least, but didn't want to press the issue. Then my ""friend"" starts talking about how they almost made all the money back through Bitcoin investment. I was like, Aw shit. Is this person going to start asking me to invest in Bitcoin. They didn't, but they started asking me of I'd ever been scammed and did I know anyone who was. The whole conversation set me on edge. I was watching everything I told them. Wishing I hadn't told them my real first name or given them my spam email account. Eventually, the conversation ended, but I felt uneasy about it. Was a person who said they'd been scammed trying to play the victim card and scam me? I unmatched them on Tinder which means unless they wrote down my spam email or link to my Line profile, they'll lose the information in our chat unless they took screenshots.

605,779,1697395772.0,Has any commoner's revolution not fail directly due to the interference of foreign powers?,"I am aware that most successful revolutions have been supported by the middle-class and military powers. The two that I think of as as closest to a successful 'People's Revolution' where the lower class masses have gathered to seize power from the upper class are the formation of the Soviet Union and Hati. 

I know Hati is the strongest case because it is a slave rebellion turned, but even then the offspring of slave owners and their slaves became sort of a middle class and supported the revolution with their expanded rights, powers, and privileges. Afterwards there were internal disputes and the other nations were quick to stomp out any chance of it being inspiration to any other slave rebellions, the effects of which can be clearly seen today. 

I know these are more modern examples though and I imagine there might have been a time when a king or some equivalent was not so powerful and a uprising of the peasantry might have been successful. I understand the thought of the average person in the past was very different than today. 

The Catholic Church had a lot more power as a propaganda tool before the enlightenment period and many asian countries were either in a collection of tribes of clans where power changes hands too often to really be considered a revolution each time or the powers that be were so well established that their people were as brainwashed as the Western nations under the Church's influence.

Even if you don't use all the local ingredients the people in France used to create the dish, you could just import the ingredients directly from France. Why do people act like you have to go to the home country of that food dish to get a 100% authentic experience? If a French person, used the french recipe, and french ingredients imported, how is that not 100% authentic? Even if a non-french person made it, if they followed it how the french person did that's still 100% authentic french food in the U.S. You would just be missing the setting of France while eating it. But even that you can recreate in other countries by designing your restaurant or outside of your restaurant a certain way.

I feel like a lot of cultures are really stuck up and stubborn about their food and grasping for something to proud of their country for, because truth be told if they didn't obsess about their food their country would have nothing going on. Maybe this is a newer thing and younger generation thing?

I live in a blue collar, middle class neighborhood. We have street boxes in our neighborhood because about 3 years ago we were told that we had to do this based on an ""attack"" on a letter carrier. So I, as all of my neighbors, put up street mailboxes to be serviced from a mail truck. About 2-3 months ago I received a note from the post office in my mailbox (the ones that have post-it glue, colored orange) telling me I had an undeliverable package, and at the bottom it says ""dog cut off"". I went to the post office where my packages were, and questioned the counter clerk, very calmly, no arguing or being rude by me or the clerk, and the clerk politely told me that when a dog was reported, they no longer  would get out of their truck to deliver to me, if it didn't fit in the mailbox, they wouldn't deliver it. 

I then called the national USPS customer service line and explained my situation, the CSR was great, and was surprised that the dog cut off statement wasn't in her system, but assured me that she would forward to my local post office for action. Less than 24 hours later I get an email telling me:

""After reviewing the information provided, due to issues with dogs in your area in the past, your block is designated a dog cut off area. What this means is, for our carrier's safety, they are not allowed to exit their vehicle for any reason, so any parcel too large to fit in your mailbox or any item that requires a signature will be noticed and will need to be picked up.""

  
I don't own a dog. There are no dogs roaming my neighborhood, though in the 11 years I've lived here I have seen maybe 2 dog running through, with an owner in pursuit, so I can't say no dog has EVER been on my street, but those are rare outliers. So I'm literally innocent of doing anything to cause whatever has happened, and now I'm told that my USPS branch will NEVER AGAIN deliver packages to my address??

  
Please tell me if I have any recourse here. I could even understand if they said this would go on for 6 months then review, or even a year, then review, but forever???  
Thanks for reading.

  
TLDR: USPS won't deliver my packages due to a dog cut off issue, I don't own a dog, and they say this ""penalty"" will be carried out in perpetuity and never be rechecked. I'm asking if I have any recourse available to have this no delivery order rescinded. ",NoStupidQuestions,1

623,802,1697394510.0,Why do people brag about gore tolerance? Am I sensitive for criticizing them?,"Let me specify before I start that I’m talking about /real/ gore, not fictional 

Is it valid for me to be frustrated with these people? People online have called me sensitive or acted superior to me. I absolutely never go around telling people that I call losers for bragging about how unbothered they are by gore about my experience but I feel like it should be common sense to not brag about being able to stomach something you have never experienced 

When I was around 12, I saw my mom’s ex boyfriend get stabbed to death right in front of me. Before that, my brother would joke around on gore websites and make me watch from time to time. I wasn’t hugely impacted by it but I was squirmy and grossed out 

My brother was with me during the incident, he hasn’t joked about or messed with real gore since 

I mean I know for a fact that at least a large majority of people online that sit there and brag about being unphased would NOT be unphased if they witnessed something like that in real life. Especially seeing how it impacted my brother who found that sort of thing entertaining like a lot of people online do. 
It happens a lot horror fandoms. A lot of horror fans will talk about how they’ve seen so many horror films that they don’t care about real gore and just no. How. I know it cannot be because of my experience solely because I know many people who haven’t had experiences that still know the common sense on how different real and fake gore are. I’m a huge horrorhead and I LOVE fictional gore. I do sfx shit and I cannot associate fictional gore with real gore whatsoever and I know it may have to do with my incident because before it I remember always seeing fake gore and squirming so hard and imagining it as real but it was still always missing that feeling. After seeing the real thing, no matter how realistic it looks on screen I just don’t think about it in any real sense 

It’s nothing about the gore itself that makes real shit hard to stomach. It’s the dreadful aura and feeling of someone before they’re about to die that makes it disturbing and I genuinely don’t know how someone could go about being “unphased” with something like that considering its something I felt in those videos even before the incident. And why someone would want to brag if they were because they obviously have some issue if they are. The core thing that frustrates me is when people act like it’s something that makes them better. Like how I mentioned a lot of horror fans try to act superior to others for being unbothered by it.

I try to look at it from a perspective of some people find it “entertaining” to watch gore due to their interest in the human body. But that makes absolutely no sense considering there’s such a massive and more DETAILED variety that actually educates and most of the videos they watch are like 3 pixels",NoStupidQuestions,1

Cooking as a feminine thing is a little easier to understand because of traditional household gender dynamics, but on the other hand male celebrity chefs are more common than female ones.  Do people find Gordon Ramsay effeminate?

708,914,1697385051.0,Was is flirting etiquette?,"My whole life I’ve been taught by women, teachers, and online culture that I need to… I guess be careful when I talk to women? Sparingly talk to women? Idk it was never really clear.

I was kind of told it’s not ok to flirt with women because it’s sexual harassment or I’m making people uncomfortable. I’ve been also told the worst places to do it are at school, work, bars, and if I see a woman enjoying being out on her own anywhere, I also shouldn’t really bother her by flirting.

So I don’t really know what to do. I kind of just wait for them to say or start something because I don’t want to be a bad person or seen as creepy or overbearing. 

I also don’t know when it’s appropriate to touch them. Again I’ve always waited for them to do that. 

I’ve had long terms relationships. Upwards of 5 years. And at the start of each I would make sure not to even sit on the same couch as them because Im afraid they’d feel uncomfortable like I’ve always been told.

And as a single person idk if I’m flirting with someone or their just being friendly. Idk if I’m aloud to gently touch them here and there to show some slight physical intimacy. Like something as small as holding their back gently while walking through crowds. Or giving them a cute shove when they say something goofy or funny. Or holding their hand to compliment their nails or bracelet. 

And kissing is out of the question. I won’t do it until they straight up ask me. 

The risk of being a bad person is way greater then the reward of someone by chance being into me. 

So what’s the etiquette? How are you supposed to flirt? When is it ok to talk to women? When is it overdoing it? What should my expectations be? Should I just be friendly and wait for them to initiate something? Is it sexual harassment and I should just take the risk? What’s the line between friendly and intimate?

745,962,1697380973.0,Am I gonna get a girlfriend again? (OCD & relationship issues),"Hi all.  
  
I'm 23 years old and have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and lately I've been thinking I might have some mild psychosis too. I'm saying this because most of the time my thoughts drift away from what's real and sometimes no longer know what is the true thinking way. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist but most of the medication didn't work and therapy... Well... It didn't work that well either. I want to ask you a question about one part of my problems.  
  
I'm actually a normal person with most of the stuff in life but when it comes to relationships I just lose my mind and don't know & think what to do. What do I mean by this? I had 2 girlfriends until now. When I was 16 and 21. The first one didn't last longer. The second one lasted for 1,5 years. And now I can't find anybody else. And I'm thinking about the possibility of not being able to find a girlfriend for the rest of my life or a very long time like 5 years, 10 years, 15 years... This thought is driving me crazy and it's making me lose connection with the reality. I no longer can think properly. I'm thinking about all those worst case scenarios where being single forever or ""What if I'll never find anybody else?"", ""What if I'm unlucky or there's a spell over me that's gonna make it impossible for me to find another one?"", ""What if this?"", ""What if that?""...  
  
Having a girlfriend means a lot to me. I guess this is why I'm having these thoughts. I try to think like a normal person but it doesn't work:  
  
\- ""Of course I'll find somebody else. Everybody does.""  
\- ""I just need to get socialize, meet with people.""  
\- ""Nobody knows the future. It's very uncertain. I have to focus on now.""  
  
NO. Sadly these kind of ways of thinking don't help me at all. I have intolerance towards uncertainty and it's making me suffer a lot and I can't get that idea of being single forever out of my mind.   
  
English is my second language. I tried to do my best while writing. If there are some mistakes I'm sorry in advance.

**In short, my problem is that I'm afraid of the possibility of not getting another girlfriend. Is this possible?**  

Thank you.

756,975,1697379542.0,Does Fingerprinting Everybody All The Time Really Keep Anyone Safe?,"My brother's youngest just graduated from high school.  For like 15 years he's been a ""parent helper"" at the school, going in to paint sets for the high school plays and do all kinds of other stuff, band booster, basketball Dad, lots of things.  Every teacher in the place knows him (it's a small school and all four of his kids went there).

He no longer has any kids at the school, but some of the kids there are friends of his daughter who just graduated, and he's still friends with the other parents. The fall play is coming up, and so one of the other Drama Club Parents asked if he would be back to help out.  He said sure, and then the school board came up with like a dozen forms he has to fill out.  Proof of covid vaccination and some others, well, fine, but they never asked before.  And they want him to get fingerprinted and have a background check.

He thinks that's idiotic; he's been at the school longer than several of the school board members have been office.  And then we got to wondering: does taking all these fingerprints really have any positive effect on student safety, or is this just a way to funnel a bunch of money to companies that do background checks?

One point for him is that he has never been fingerprinted.  His prints aren't in any database anywhere.  If he does this, now they will be, and that's bothering him.  I told him it's no big deal; I had a job with a security clearance once and I'd been fingerprinted and had a background check.  He replied by mentioning cases where people were wrongly accused or convicted of crimes because a fingerprint at a crime scene was incorrectly matched with their fingerprint, which can only happen if your fingerprint is in a database somewhere.  Sure, it's rare (but maybe not as rare as we hope it is), but it does happen.

Then I got to thinking about how after 9/11 the government went bonkers with spying on everybody, spending billions of dollars to no good purpose, and never actually catching a single actual terrorist.  Is this another case like that?  Is there any actual evidence that fingerprinting everybody all the time genuinely works to prevent crimes?

I've been friends with this lady since 2018. I liked her a lot, so did she. She gave me all the green lights possible, saying I'm the perfect type of guy physically, asking multiple times why I've not asked her out, I'll just give the generic excuse that its not about her, its me.
I'm sure you'd be wondering what I was waiting for. Well, I do have a Small dick, and she was usually vocal about liking big dicks, talking about wanting to 'feel full'. Even going as far as mocking guys with Small dicks, wondering how they manage to survive with the 'shame'.

So our friendship has been fine since then, though she was clearly getting frustrated as she refused to hang out several times during subsequent years. She moved to a different city in 2021, and we've barely communicated on phone since.

Anyways, I travelled to her City recently, and guess who i ran into. The meeting was pleasant enough, until I mistakenly suggested to catch up. She begrudgingly accepted, even stating she may not have the chance, and I hope thats the case.

This sounds like something that shouldn't really be an issue, so why am I worried about catching up with a friend of 5 years? Well, I do kind of feel like I've not been fair to her. Women rarely show their intentions that overtly, plus I didn't meet her by chance, I actually cold approached her, so obviously, her confusion is understandable. Our relationship has deteriorated over the years, and I do kind of miss her. Outside of hating Small dicks, she's a nice person to be around. 

If I have the chance meet up with her before leaving,  I'm thinking of opening up to her, and telling her the reason why I've never tried to ask her out.

i (22f) have been doing a lot of self reflection lately and i have noticed there has been one commonality across almost all of my relationships that have ended (both romantic and platonic). almost all of these relationships have ended with the other party telling me that i deserve better than what they can give me. i’ve noticed this because when i look to my parents and their generation i see them with friends they’ve had their entire lives and i can’t help but feel a tinge of jealousy. now, i know that i’m definitely not alone in this experience as a lot of people in my generation are feeling so isolated and lonely. i don’t know if it’s social media, a change in society, or if i am really the problem. i’m left wondering is saying this an easy cop out to get out of a relationship or friendship you no longer want to be in? i guess what i’m asking of you, redditors, is if you’ve been the one to say “you deserve better” to someone when ending a relationship did you truly mean it? or was it a way for you to cut ties with someone in an amicable way? i know there aren’t very many details in this, it’s more of a stream of consciousness that i’d like to know other’s opinions on. let me know what you think!

And my personal take is that if you don't want to be friends with someone that has a baby, (especially when you're still teenagers), that should not be frowned upon.  Obviously there are right and wrong ways to go about ending a friendship in any context, but I just think that if you are that young, and your peers are having kids and you are just not comfortable to have to start hanging out with that friend and their child, you shouldn't have to.  And you shouldn't be shamed for not wanting to.

I’m not religious, nor do I think I necessarily have conservative values - yet I’m bothered by my partners low number of previous sexual partners (4) despite it being the same as my own. I’ve had intrusive thoughts and obsess over details, which made me think it’s OCD/retroactive jealousy - but when those thoughts subside I’m left with an underlying “feeling” and think about the number of past partners my girlfriend has had. I don’t necessarily feel disgusted, or fearful of anything - I just don’t like it, and it sits in my mind mostly all day every day. 

I know I love my partner, I know I see a future with her, and if any of my friends came to me about this issue I’d tell them 4 previous partners is next to nothing and to not worry about it. But why do I feel differently? Why do I hold myself to different standards as I hold my partner? To me, having 4 previous partners is nothing - I was made fun of at uni for not having enough “fun” and for having a poor dating life haha. 

If this is a deeply ingrained misogynistic trait from my own mind, can I change this with time? I’m aware that my thoughts are unfair and hypocritical, and I’m aware they’re preventing me from being fully happy. I don’t want to be in a relationship where I’m always low key holding something against my partner, but I feel this thought process will follow me to new relationships - and I don’t necessarily want a virgin partner. 

I want to change my thought process and become more accepting, and stop holding double standards. But is this truly possible? Or am I stuck like this forever? Because if I am, I’m going to live a very sad, lonely life.

The thing is, I don’t actually know if they’re homeless or not.

My husband had an organ transplant. If you weren't aware, you need to take certain medications to prevent your immune system from attacking the new organ. Now Medicare was paying for the medication up to three years after transplant, which ran out this summer. So we had to use our private insurance, which wouldn't cover it because they prefer a different brand. My husband can't take their preferred brand because the side effects interfered with his quality of life. So we appealed and they agreed to cover it.

Well, the doctors changed his dose. So we were waiting for the insurance company to approve it, the doctors to give prior authorization (whatever that is) and for the pharmacy to get the ok. For. A. Month. Thankfully we had a backup supply that he could use but that ran out over the weekend. Two days worth of phone calls led to us learning we had to appeal it to the insurance company again because even though it's the same medication it was a different dose. Then I had to drive an hour round trip to a different pharmacy because the one down the road didn't have it.

Are other countries like this? Does your insurance company have the final say in what medication you can take based on who they have a deal with? Is it this hard anywhere else to get critical medication?

Part of the problem is that I have but a vague idea what I’m trying to ask. Here goes : A few years ago, my kids’ Boy Scout troop took what felt like a pretty clandestine trip to a water sanitation plant, (I think). Truly, I have no recollection of exactly what they did at this place, (I knew at the time, I just can’t remember).

 “Bob,” our tour guide, who pretty much agreed to let 40  little kids walk around the place on a whim, took us into this large two story building that we entered into on the second floor. There was a cat walk that spanned the length of the room, and that’s what we stood on. 20 or more feet below us was the water. The room was dark, very stinky, and that water was black and still. So here we are on this catwalk with all our kids and, like, the absolute bare minimum for railing, and Bob says, “if anyone fell in this water they’d sink straight to the bottom because it has no oxygen.” 

 There, that’s the whole reason for this post, I promptly scooted my kids out of there while other kids climbed all over that railing for a better look. This has always bothered me, because it seems so dangerous and I don’t know why Bob or anyone else would think that letting 40 ten and under children run along that cat walk was a good idea. 

 Last night it occurred to me that maybe Bob was actually full of poop and had no idea what he was talking about, that would make me feel better. Like, knowing that if a child had fallen into that water an adult could have rescued them would make me feel better. (I should say here that it did not appear to me that there was some other safeguard in place, but maybe someone who is familiar with water treatment plants knows that there would have been). 

 So, is there water that a human body would be unable to float or swim in, and is it likely that the water at this treatment plant was in that category? Was this as dangerous as I felt it was?",NoStupidQuestions,1

I’ve tried telling him I wasn’t sure on the answers or taken a long time to respond, but he hasn’t gotten the hint and keeps asking.

Yesterday I was showering with my boyfriend, and when I dumped the soap juice out while washing he was flabbergasted, stating, ""YOU'RE the one who's been doing that?!"" He said that the soap gunk is an important aspect of having a soap dish, and that the soapwater being there is, like, the whole point.

Over the year we stayed in touch and would have times where we would try to work on things, have sex, go out etc. 
It turned ugly because I found out he was on dating sites while telling me we are working on things, also he'd like womens Instagram pics which is one of my pet peeves. Just alot of disrespectful shit. Anyways so we'd set up days for him to get his belongings maybe like a bag here and there, we'd always end up having sex talking etc and ""trying again"". 
But this time I moved on and he doesn't want the relationship either. 
But now he wants to sue me for money I owe him? I don't owe him money. The only thing may be that the puppy (we got together**) destroyed his couch. The dressers and bed, those items have been in my house for a year. He never made real effort to get them. Now he wants them a year later and wants to sue me. I told him he can have the dressers but the bed is staying because I've slept in it alone for a year and he bought a new bed anyways so him wanting a bed that isn't even in great condition (cause of the puppy, he left me to raise alone!) .

It disgusts me he wants to sue me because my parents actually bought him a car while we were together, my family did more for him in a year than his whole family has done for him, he lived in MY home for a year I did his laundry, cooked, cleaned, we had a great relationship while i was pregnant. He did pay half my mortage which helped  but thats expected of since he lived in MY house.
I'm just disgusted by him that he may actually sue. Idk if he's bluffing or what. 
I believe the rules in PA are he abanded his items and never got them within 30 days.
He never made attempts within the 30 days after moving out to get bed or dressers. A year ago. 
He's maybe mentioned throughout the year but our schedules wouldn't work out, he didn't have help, no storage unit yet, etc etc always excuses. And then sometimes we'd fight and I would say no I don't want you anywhere near my house but this was said 6 months after his bed and dressers were left without him living with me.

I kept telling her to leave me alone and stop tickling me, but she refused to listen and kept on tickling me. I'm not joking when I say this, but she would not stop tickling me for half an hour. I finally had enough. When she was about to tickle me again, I dug my fingers into both of her arms. The digging wasn't enough to draw blood, but it did stop her from tickling me again. She yelled in pain, and then I pushed her onto the floor and went to my bedroom. Our parents were out grocery shopping at the time. When they both returned, I told them what had happened.

So yeah even i didn't do anything wrong i always jump to the possibility that i did something wrong or said something stupid which lead to overthinking and misunderstanding and taking responsibility for stuff i don't even relate to on my shoulders which become unnecessary burden

Does anyone know why? If I'm wrong, no matter what for, I discuss like an adult why or why not I am wrong, and have a basic debate like a normal human. But a lot of people I met seem to not be able to do that. 

Example: 

Person says ""Cotton is made of metal. Anyone who thinks otherwise is an idiot."" 

I respond ""I do not believe you are correct, could you enlighten me as to how you came about that thought process?""

They respond ""Oh I see, you're just an idiot who doesn't know how life functions, your word isn't law, fuck you and the horse you rode on. I betcha you eat bugs for breakfast and I hope you get hit by a car."" 

And then they walk away, or block you before you can respond.

Very recently I've been trying to learn Norwegian by myself, I'm actually finding it pretty fun, I count to 20 multiple times a day, I practice random things like introductions, ordering a coffee, checking into a hotel, etc throughout the day and it's been cool. Will I ever use it? Who knows? The thing that I really struggle with when I watch Norwegian videos is that Norwegian speakers talk with their throat, and I do my best to try to mimic it and after an hour or so my throat and even my chest to a smaller degree gets tired and I have to stop. Never in my life have I ever really thought much about the mechanics of my day-to-day English speaking.

1140,494,1697521731.0,"Is it stupid to expect true love, and leave if I don’t find it?","I’ve been a little bit (translation: extremely and debilitatingly) lonely recently and well, I’ve been fairly confused about how I should act / what I should expect when dating. I’ve always been fairly emotionally sensitive/fragile, and I don’t think it’s healthy for me to date people if I don’t get the quantity of love I feel I need.  I’m very scared of the possibility of love dying out over time, and I really have become almost depressed at the thought that I will never find a person that will reciprocate as much love as I want to give.  

I feel like dating someone whom you have ceased to be in love with is unfair to you and to the person you’re dating, but I’m also scared if I spend my life searching for the perfect person I’ll run out of time and end up alone.  I know fairytale love is rare, but anything less seems almost depressing.  I have a need to love and be loved, not just passively, but I feel I need to be IN love. I fear that that need will forever be unfulfilled, and it’s taking a huge toll on my mental health.  So much so that I’m often finding myself crying at night, and having to distract myself from thinking about it, because the moment I do start thinking of it I just can’t stop.  

So, if I’m in a relationship and the fire goes out, is it reasonable for me to leave, even if we still love eachother?  When I hear people talk about their relationships, it’s almost always depressing.  Of course there’s the occasional one that gives me hope, like [this](https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/s4OnlapYgQ) one,  but is it reasonable to search for that type of love, even if it means giving up relationships that many people would stay in for the rest of their lives? 

I’ve made the mistake of scrolling Reddit for a few years and I’m sure the sheer number of depressing stories on here have affected my judgement of relationships, but normal love just doesn’t seem like it’s enough for me.  I feel like if the love fizzles out, I’d become completely overwhelmed by the fear of missing out on the possibility of “true love” that I would become a bad partner, and I don’t think it’s fair to stay in a relationship if that relationship will never fill your desires, the whole idea of “settling” seems so wrong to me, if you’re “settling” that means that there’s something better out there, and you’ve essentially just given up, and that is not something I would ever want to do. 

And what happens when the love does fizzle out? Especially if you’re married the way people talk about it seems like they just accept it and never go back to being in love again.  I don’t know if I could handle falling out of love with someone I thought would be the one I loved forever.

So, here’s what I want (need) and feel like is unattainable.

-a relationship where the honeymoon phase never ends (or at least where you stay in-love like the post I mentioned [(this one)](https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/s4OnlapYgQ)

-a partner that needs and wants me as much as I need them

-a partner I feel secure with, and who always has my back

-someone I can look at and no matter how bad I’ve been feeling know that my life matters so much more because of them, and that I would give anything for them.

I know people will say I am putting too much emphasis on this part of my life, but I can’t help it, it’s the purest desire I’ve ever felt, it’s unwavering, unquenchable, and all devouring.  Everything I do now, is depressing because I realize I could be doing it with someone I love. It’s like a switch suddenly flipped and I realized I’ve been seeing in black and white my whole life, but the only way to see color is to go through a lifetime of heartbreak and pain, uncertainty and anguish, just for a chance to feel the love I so desperately need to feel.  So, what the fuck do I do?  And to those who have these mythical relationships where your love doesn’t fade, how do you keep that? And to those whose love has fizzled out, what changed from the honeymoon phase that made you and your partner drift apart?

Apologies for the long post, this is sort of half because I want answers, and half because I feel like writing out my feelings helps a bit.  Also, as you probably guessed, I’m fairly young (early 20’s) and sort of trying to understand my fears and feelings.",NoStupidQuestions,1

Today, she came to class wearing a band tee that’s mine and I didn’t know she still had. I acted surprised and told her I wanna wear it this weekend to a concert I’m going to. No response from her except a laugh. 

Normally at the end of class she would walk over to me smiling and make chit chat. This time, when class ended, she put on her headphones and walked away fast. Then whenever I walked past her on campus again she was ignoring me — didn’t make eye contact at all. Find it weird for someone who spent the whole day yesterday cuddling and watching movies with me. And kissing me even more than she did by the end of our relationship. 

She had told me on Wednesday that she would only reach out to me once and then that if I wanted to see her again, the ball was in my court. Yet she was the one to ask if she could come over again twice. And then last night I think she wanted to smoke with me and I told her we could hang later in the week. I asked her when she’s free and she said she would let me know. “Okiee ill lyk”. I didn’t see reason to text back. So I feel like maybe she’s mad that I’m not the one putting in effort but to be frank she hasn’t given me the space yet to reach out first.

If instead of getting paid weekly/monthly and you got your entire yearly wage, once off, one of day of the entire year, and that was it, would it be easier to live off that, instead of people currently living paycheck to paycheck?

So if you earned 50-60k a year, instead of the 2-3k you get a month, you just get your entire yearly wage once off, one massive pay, logically you would then go, ok my entire years rent is ""blank"" here it is pay it, then the rest of your bills, then live off the rest... right?

I have this artwork which occurred naturally, and I feel as though some type of rich collector might find it appealing enough to pay a lot of money.

I mean, it's uncanny how picture-perfect this artwork is.

It's simply a rough cut panel/board/plank of wood. The woodgrain, for some strange reason, created an unimaginable looking copy of some sort of shark.

I worked at a lumber mill awhile back, I watched thousands of boards of wood pass by me on a conveyor belt every week. I'd see all kinds of woodgrain-images which vaguely resembled faces/objects.

One day, a board of wood came down the line and I just so happen to notice this work of art. I asked a nearby saw operator to roughly cut the image out of the board, kind of like a plaque that you'd hang on a wall. 

I now own this thing, this completely natural image of a shark. The board of wood is about 9 inches long, 1 inch deep, 4 inches wide. 
The woodgrain shark took on a dark green appearance, it even appears to have varying degrees of ""shading."" As if it were painted on by an artist. 
It's unmistakably a shark, a very detailed shark.

1238,620,1697510878.0,Is it better to call someone out or just leave in silence?,"Specifically, I've been dealing with a now former coworker who, I don't know what her true motive is anymore. She's a married woman with 3 kids.

At first, I thought she just needed someone to talk to. But I guess this became an emotional affair because of how she'd compare me to her husband. She invited me over, ""off the books"", and while her husband and kids weren't home for what I now assume was a physical affair. But I'm assuming the husband showed up cause she abruptly cancelled last second.

Since then, she became obsessive. Texting me all the time. Getting upset if I didn't text back (but it's okay if she doesn't), listening to her issues or even coming to talk to her. She even texted me, ""were you here and didn't come say hi to me?"". She's even physically chased after me on more than one occasion.

Now that she doesn't work with me anymore, she finds some excuse to text me or call me every 3 months. It's been her car breaking down, asking stupid questions about the Internet or even something marvel movie related. But she won't answer me after a while and it's annoying.

I know the easy answer is the block her. But I still physically see her because she's still involved in a way at work and we see each other at sports games.

Part of me really wants to just completely call her out. Like when she calls answer saying it's her backup husband speaking or something. But I know the passive route may be easier but she always loses her shit if I go radio silent on her.

I have some common sense so im not going to just yell out ""hey guys look at me im depressed"" or so on, but if I get into a conversation and I feel as if I can comfortably speak on a sensitive topic with this person-- I will. Whether I've known them for a few minutes or a few years. Of course I won't speak on things that I may still have shame from or embarrassing stuff that if it were to ""be used against me"" I wouldn't really care.
But when I was doing this, the other party was fine but my mother got annoyed and angry that I would go to these people about it.
Now I was very confused from her reaction so I went to a friend for a little help and they said ""maybe she just doesn't want you to tell everyone your business,""
which if it had anything to do with her I wouldn't have said anything since it's not my story to speak on...But this was MY story and I was telling it to people who's been vulnerable with me and genuinely gave me good advice.
So I guess, that being said is it wrong to be open? I feel like I don't struggle with social ques and I know there's a time and a place so... Idk Im just a little confused.

in case anyone asks for specific information. 
tw; SA?
but what happened was I was 
Basically groped by a co-worker. It made me feel very gross and uncomfortable. 
I went to my mother (who works with me) and well we didn't really talk about it. She's just the type to not want to dwell on stuff like that while I need to release how I feel to other's or in general.
Well I still struggled with believing it wasn't my fault it happened so I came to these 2 older women coworkers of mine that are very open and accepting. I told them what happened and I was told to report to HR...which unfortunately I will not be doing.
They spoke to me about ways to protect myself etc and overall how to not be a naive 19yo girl 😮‍💨
but my mother took it as me claiming she didn't care because I should have came to her first about it (i did)
and then it just blew up.
I know I'm young and naive so im still learning, my judgment may not always be right ever... But my mother threw it in my face and essentially blamed me for what happened and accused me of acting too grown and giving my trust too easily.

I'm trying to get a state identification card, while being unable to visit a BMV near me (Ohio).

I've had my drivers license for 10 years but I didn't make the deadline to renew before it expired. I'm severely agoraphobic nowadays and I'm unable to leave my house. The covid lockdowns created such anxiety and stress in my life, and being unable to do anything or leave - just left me homebound. Overtime it developed into a major condition.

However, as I'm unable to leave my house, and the closest BMV is 25 minutes away - which is completely outside of my comfort zone; I'm just unable to go there. The issue arises when I can't get any online doctors to assist me because they can't verify my identity. I can't seem to do anything anymore without some sort of identity. I can't start an online business because I can't verify my identity to accept payments, I can't manage crypto because of the same reason. I can't do anything without getting a state ID card.

Is there a way, or an organization that's able to help people in my situation?

I'm back in the U.S. now, and I have a job I originally loved, but it's starting to kind of suck. I'd read some less-than-flattering things about the boss on company-review sites, knew it could be true, but took this job anyway. It's good money, I need the health insurance, and it's work I know how to do fairly well, which always brings with it some degree of satisfaction.

But recently, the boss has become ...let's just say....how they were described in company reviews online. I'm seeing how everyone, myself included, is stressed, stretched way beyond their capacity, and working to meet unrealistic goals set by the boss. Plus, we're all having tasks handed to us that are not in line with our actual position because there's no one else to do these tasks.

I told my boss I'm at capacity last week, and they nodded with faux-sympathy and added another massive task to my roster (urgent, of course), a task that another employee, stretched way beyond capacity, has no room to handle.

I'm even being messaged by my boss on weekends, though I don't answer.

I had read online that my company culture is terrible and that the stress of this place will be unmanageable, and I'm a cynic who always assumed companies suck ass by default, but this is wild. Everyone walks (or types, as we're remote) on eggshells around this person. It's completely wild. I feel like I'm in a TV show.

why do people make jokes about getting the runs or being chained to a toilet after eating certain food so much?

like Mexican food, fast food, etc. 

This has only happened to me once in my documentable life. I went to a diner while traveling 3 days in a row, and the food was mad greasy, so it did give me uh.. somewhat loose stools. But other than this? I’ve always just pooped like normal. The times when I do have looser stools (diarrhea is such an ugly word. I can’t bring myself to say it), it’s always due to either illness or menses. Never diet. 

I know that if your stomach isn’t used to the grease, it can affect you. But I grew up barely eating fast food since my mom was a stickler over it, and yet I still have never had my waste affected when I consume fast food.

What I don’t understand is this- I am a healthy young man who will maybe see a primary care physician once a year, which upon googling, will cost me anywhere from $100-$200 per visit. That’s lower than ALL of the monthly premiums I am seeing. And then a specialist visit could be $300-$500, but if I still haven’t reached my deductible, that means I have to pay that out of pocket, which is kind of like I don’t have insurance at all, no? If my deductible is $7,000, that means I have to see 14 specialists per year at $500 per visit before the insurance company even starts doing what I am paying into it for. That’s absurd! And I don’t even get vision or dental on this plan, so I ask, what even is the point?

Is this normal?,"I'm in my early 20s, so I'm supposed to be in my sexual prime. But I can't help but feel like sex is a chore. People my age go on and on about how great sex is, some even do stupid things or put themselves in risky situations just to have sex, but I often just sit there not really understanding what all the hullabaloo is about. I wasn't raised in a religious household, but sex was never talked about, almost taboo. Unlike most people in high school, I graduated high school having never has sex, let alone kissing anyone. So I wonder if that has anything to do with it? Maybe not really being allowed to have sex or explore intimacy as a teenager like most people do killed something in me unconsciously. I remember even after my first time, which was when I was 18 after graduating high school, the guy that I was with I was really attracted to physically and emotionally. We had sex and then I thought to myself, ""Is that it? Is that all there is?"" But I remember when I was in high school I almost had a constant hard-on. Maybe never having those desires fulfilled as a boy turned me off under the surface, but I'm unaware of it 

I've been told to try different toys, different kinds of lube, different positions, to change it up, and I have done all that.

I'm gay and I once had a guy who didn't douche beforehand and when I penetrated him after awhile I realized there was poop on my penis. That was two years ago, so I'm over it, but I sometimes do think about that. I've had sexual partners comment on how I often seem confused or disinterested or stare into space or look bored when having sex. It's odd because even with someone I find hot it's never really been fulfilling in the end. Even when I was 18 and I was new to sex, I found that I sometimes wouldn't even get erect.

Lots of strip malls advertise these cheap and quick massage parlors behind curtained windows with generic names like “Sun Spa” etc. I’ve had two friends who have anecdotally visited spas that included some kind of “happy ending” that they weren’t expecting.

I’m in the market for a cheap massage, but I’m seriously hoping to avoid that kind of “mix-up” altogether. This has literally stopped me from going to get one, as I become doubly convinced that the price is reflecting the additional services and not the quality of the massage itself - and that even if I do bite the bullet and say “no thank you,” it’s probably not gonna be the best massage because that’s just not the spa’s focus.

For context I’ve only gotten massages in sports therapy settings and once or twice at a hotel spa.
I’m at the point where I’m convinced that every cheap walk-in place is gonna mean I have to clarify that it’s not a sexual thing. God forbid I say something before and they’re literally a wholesome family-run spa. But also, god forbid somebody touches my butthole before I can say “no thanks.”

1:When the question arose,it first showed itself on paper relatively quickly in the convo,so while they could have thought it was ""dividing in half"" instead of dividing by half, the equation already showed 300/0.5 on paper,as well as the 300/2 to clear up that possible misconception.

Some days I'd wake up at 2am, other days I'd wake up at 5pm.I had a routine for a few days, it would get disturbed, throw me into a new routine that would last 4-7 days. So I had a different sleep pattern every week. 

I'd come down and my mum would ask me something like ""Have you just woke up?"" I've had this conversation enough times to know it's not a real question. She already had the answer in her head and is just waiting for me to give that answer so we can have an argument over it. So instead of answering her, I call her out on it. Tell her she already knows what the answer is and every time we have this conversation it devolves into an argument, so why even ask the question. It replaces the initial anger she felt with embarrassment because she went in with an expectation of how the conversation was going to turn out and I flipped it into calling her out on her behaviour.

So the technique is recognising patterns in somebodies behaviour and using that to deduce what their motivation is and then instead of having the conversation go the way they planned you've used that information to flip the topic back onto them and now you're talking about their behaviour instead of your own.

We do a lot of volume and when we started there were three pharmacists to cover including me. But last week the other two have left and it's just me. We're a retail store and we open early at 7am and stay open late until 11pm for people who work different schedules, and were open like this M-F, and then 7am to 9pm on Saturday, and 7-7 on Sundays. With just me here I'm working every single one of those hours since I'm the only pharmacist and you can't open a pharmacy without me legally, so last week I literally worked over 100 hours. I can't even leave for a lunch or dinner break because one I'm so busy I barely have time to eat, and two we'd have to close the pharmacy down while I'm gone.

To make things worse, my owner thinks that since I'm a ""professional"" I need to just put up with the hours and deal with it. He thinks it's unprofessional to sit down at all while working since we're a pharmacy. There literally isn't a chair in the whole building. But refuses to buy any of those cushioned floor mats. I have to wear business casual shoes as well for our dress code since he thinks the pharmacists need to dress professionally not in sneakers or anything, so I wear a pair of ballet flats everyday.

Hi, so I keep hearing about countries like the UK and Sweden having a lot of criminals that are immigrants. They form the same street gangs that are very common in the poor unsafe countries they came from.

What I don't understand is, why is criminality a risk with immigration specifically? Imagine if a native hang out with a group and assaulted someone on the street, they would be arrested. What makes an immigrant doing that any different or any more difficult to deal with?

I was kind of told it’s not ok to flirt with women because it’s sexual harassment or I’m making people uncomfortable. I’ve been also told the worst places to do it are at school, work, bars, and if I see a woman enjoying being out on her own anywhere, I also shouldn’t really bother her by flirting.

So I don’t really know what to do. I kind of just wait for them to say or start something because I don’t want to be a bad person or seen as creepy or overbearing. 

I also don’t know when it’s appropriate to touch them. Again I’ve always waited for them to do that. 

I’ve had long terms relationships. Upwards of 5 years. And at the start of each I would make sure not to even sit on the same couch as them because Im afraid they’d feel uncomfortable like I’ve always been told.

And as a single person idk if I’m flirting with someone or their just being friendly. Idk if I’m aloud to gently touch them here and there to show some slight physical intimacy. Like something as small as holding their back gently while walking through crowds. Or giving them a cute shove when they say something goofy or funny. Or holding their hand to compliment their nails or bracelet. 

And kissing is out of the question. I won’t do it until they straight up ask me. 

The risk of being a bad person is way greater then the reward of someone by chance being into me. 

So what’s the etiquette? How are you supposed to flirt? When is it ok to talk to women? When is it overdoing it? What should my expectations be? Should I just be friendly and wait for them to initiate something? Is it sexual harassment and I should just take the risk? What’s the line between friendly and intimate?

1657,163,1697380973.0,Am I gonna get a girlfriend again? (OCD & relationship issues),"Hi all.  
  
I'm 23 years old and have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and lately I've been thinking I might have some mild psychosis too. I'm saying this because most of the time my thoughts drift away from what's real and sometimes no longer know what is the true thinking way. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist but most of the medication didn't work and therapy... Well... It didn't work that well either. I want to ask you a question about one part of my problems.  
  
I'm actually a normal person with most of the stuff in life but when it comes to relationships I just lose my mind and don't know & think what to do. What do I mean by this? I had 2 girlfriends until now. When I was 16 and 21. The first one didn't last longer. The second one lasted for 1,5 years. And now I can't find anybody else. And I'm thinking about the possibility of not being able to find a girlfriend for the rest of my life or a very long time like 5 years, 10 years, 15 years... This thought is driving me crazy and it's making me lose connection with the reality. I no longer can think properly. I'm thinking about all those worst case scenarios where being single forever or ""What if I'll never find anybody else?"", ""What if I'm unlucky or there's a spell over me that's gonna make it impossible for me to find another one?"", ""What if this?"", ""What if that?""...  
  
Having a girlfriend means a lot to me. I guess this is why I'm having these thoughts. I try to think like a normal person but it doesn't work:  
  
\- ""Of course I'll find somebody else. Everybody does.""  
\- ""I just need to get socialize, meet with people.""  
\- ""Nobody knows the future. It's very uncertain. I have to focus on now.""  
  
NO. Sadly these kind of ways of thinking don't help me at all. I have intolerance towards uncertainty and it's making me suffer a lot and I can't get that idea of being single forever out of my mind.   
  
English is my second language. I tried to do my best while writing. If there are some mistakes I'm sorry in advance.

**In short, my problem is that I'm afraid of the possibility of not getting another girlfriend. Is this possible?**  

Thank you.

1671,179,1697379542.0,Does Fingerprinting Everybody All The Time Really Keep Anyone Safe?,"My brother's youngest just graduated from high school.  For like 15 years he's been a ""parent helper"" at the school, going in to paint sets for the high school plays and do all kinds of other stuff, band booster, basketball Dad, lots of things.  Every teacher in the place knows him (it's a small school and all four of his kids went there).

He no longer has any kids at the school, but some of the kids there are friends of his daughter who just graduated, and he's still friends with the other parents. The fall play is coming up, and so one of the other Drama Club Parents asked if he would be back to help out.  He said sure, and then the school board came up with like a dozen forms he has to fill out.  Proof of covid vaccination and some others, well, fine, but they never asked before.  And they want him to get fingerprinted and have a background check.

He thinks that's idiotic; he's been at the school longer than several of the school board members have been office.  And then we got to wondering: does taking all these fingerprints really have any positive effect on student safety, or is this just a way to funnel a bunch of money to companies that do background checks?

One point for him is that he has never been fingerprinted.  His prints aren't in any database anywhere.  If he does this, now they will be, and that's bothering him.  I told him it's no big deal; I had a job with a security clearance once and I'd been fingerprinted and had a background check.  He replied by mentioning cases where people were wrongly accused or convicted of crimes because a fingerprint at a crime scene was incorrectly matched with their fingerprint, which can only happen if your fingerprint is in a database somewhere.  Sure, it's rare (but maybe not as rare as we hope it is), but it does happen.

Then I got to thinking about how after 9/11 the government went bonkers with spying on everybody, spending billions of dollars to no good purpose, and never actually catching a single actual terrorist.

ive recently noticed that if an object does something unexpected, i immediately say ""ow"". i could drop a pen on the floor, nowhere near my foot, and say ow. a ball could be thrown towards my head and land a few metres away, and i will still say ow.

this realization led my high mind down a really weird train of thought that led me to the question, if people were to see something harmful happen to them in a vr world or something similar, would they respond to the pain??

for example, if im in a fucked up SAO situation where ive been trapped in a digital but ""real"" body where i can feel everything but not *really --* if i saw my arm cut off, would i feel it? would it matter how long ive been stuck there, for something psychological to happen with my perception of pain? what if my digital body doesnt necessarily process it as pain but you in your head KNOW it should hurt?

1690,209,1697377410.0,Why do people act like high interest rates on cars are such a big deal?,"First off, I'm gonna start off with the fact that interest on everything right now is ridiculous. It's entirely too high in general, and on something like a house, it could literally change your mortgage cost by more than $1000/month by paying a 7% interest rate vs 5%. So that's definitely notable.

But my question here is about cars specifically. Interest has a way smaller impact on a short-term purchase worth tens of thousands of dollars.

Just for fun, I configured a 2024 Honda CR-V and compared the monthly finance cost at different interest rates. With my configuration, the car came out to $36,175 on their website (I'm sure this would be higher at the actual point of sale because if dealer fees, etc., but that's beside the point). Right now, Honda has a promo where a 5 year loan is at 4.9% interest, which is decent. 

The monthly cost for a 5 year loan on a $36,175 car with 10% down (which are all pretty standard terms) is [$671/month at 4.9%](https://i.imgur.com/v5j2V7a.jpg). With 0 changes except bumping the interest rate to 7%, the monthly cost goes up to [$706/month](https://i.imgur.com/5Y7igM6.jpg).

At the monthly scale, that's a $35 difference. That increase is negligible in the grand scheme of things. Even by the end of the loan, you will have paid a grand total of $40,260 on the 4.9% rate vs $42,360 at 7%. Yeah that's an extra $2100, but again that's over the course of 5 years, so it's only $420/year.

I'm not saying this to get people to try to buy cars. Shit's expensive rn. Yall do what you want with your money. All I'm wondering is why an interest rate a few percent higher takes a car from ""affordable"" territory to ""not worth it"" for so many people when the total monthly cost difference is <$50 in a lot of cases",NoStupidQuestions,1

1708,234,1697374407.0,"Most police departments nowadays have strict ""don't pursue"" policies which claim to result in fewer deaths/injuries of innocent bystanders. Has anyone researched if this effect holds up on a macro scale?","I've wondered this, since these policies started rolling out a decade or so ago. I feel like we should have enough data by now to answer this question.

There's no doubt that for an individual incident, the decision of police not to engage in a high speed pursuit lessens the danger to the public. But does it also encourage criminals to engage in riskier behavior, knowing that they have a lower chance of being caught? 

Say that enacting such policies have caused a 50% reduction in public risk on a per-incident basis; if criminals feel empowered to do more illegal things as a result, and deaths/injuries in aggregate are 2x higher...maybe we're actually better off going back to the old model.

I know you could argue this same thing for other things like some cities' decisions to stop prosecuting certain low-level crimes.

1747,287,1697367680.0,Contact lenses?,"Hi! I got some really dumb questions. Basically it’s been around 8 years since I’ve found out I can’t see well in the distance. Of course as time passed I started seeing worse since I didn’t wear glasses or contacts or anything and here I am today having trouble seeing clearly even when I’m 1 meter away. I also have this issue where my eyes get really tired when I’m at college, I have to wipe them frequently through the day because they feel so uncomfortable and I also rarely get some tears in them. I was thinking of maybe going to the doctor and getting some contact lenses (I’m not wearing glasses no matter what) and perhaps in the summer I could look into surgery since I believe I’m too young to start struggling with contacts from now on for the rest of my life. I also sometimes get teary eyes when the wind is blowing hard in them so I’m afraid maybe they might be too sensitive for contacts? Or can anyone wear contacts? Are they less expensive than glasses? I know glasses are quite expensive and I don’t want to buy those just to wear them for 1 year + I hate the look. I’m also quite afraid of putting them in, I don’t want to scratch my eyes or anything like that. I also heard they can fall, does that happen often? And the most important and dumb question: I have a really good tolerance when it comes to screens. I play video games for 5 hours a day every single day and do not wish to stop or do anything that could minimize that time. If I get contacts I assume it should be better, right? My eyes would be more rested and it won’t negatively impact the time I can spend in front of a screen, either pc or phone, right?.. I just won’t bother doing anything about my eyes issues if there’s even a tiny chance I won’t be able to spend the same amount of time in front of screens anymore. I nap everyday because I do feel tired, but even when I don’t feel that tired I still nap to rest my eyes. Also how would the doctor appoinment go? I hate not knowing what’s going to happen. I hope they won’t be like „try different lenses and see when you see well enough” because I would have no idea what would be a good enough vision.

1757,299,1697365954.0,"Is there scientific evidence supporting the hypothesis that the human brain operates in two distinct modes, one of production and another of consumption?","I have been pondering the idea that the brain operates on two distinct levels or modes, and I am unsure whether this concept holds scientific validity. My hypothesis revolves around the notion that our cognitive processes can be primarily categorized into two modes: production and consumption. I believe that these modes are fundamentally different, each pertaining to specific types of tasks.  
  
In the mode of production, individuals are actively engaged in activities such as cleaning dishes, playing games, musical instrument performances, or even walking. During this phase, we are essentially executing actions, relying on our existing knowledge or immediate environmental feedback to guide our actions. This mode appears to be the opposite of consuming information, as our primary focus is on output.  
  
Conversely, the mode of consumption pertains to activities involving the intake of information, which could include reading books, watching television series, listening to a speaker, or simply absorbing information from our surroundings. This mode revolves around information reception rather than active output.  
  
Remarkably, there exists a unique medium in which both these modes coexist harmoniously, and that is the act of having a conversation. Engaging in a conversation entails both the production of thoughts, words, and responses as well as the consumption of information through active listening and interpretation. The simultaneous utilization of both production and consumption modes in conversation results in a distinct and pleasurable experience.  
  
One fascinating observation I've made is that when I engage in the mode of production for several days in a row, I often experience exhaustion, and my mind naturally gravitates towards seeking a balance by shifting into the mode of consumption. Conversely, after extended periods of consuming information, I find myself inclined to engage in productive activities. This cyclical interplay between production and consumption is of particular interest to me.  
  
My question is whether there is any scientific basis or research in the fields of neurobiology and cognitive psychology that supports or contradicts this hypothesis. Can the brain truly be categorized into these two modes of production and consumption, and are there any known mechanisms or processes underlying this differentiation?

While it gave me horrible anxiety and hurt so much to listen to, I couldn’t stop for weeks on end, every day. (We broke up in August, ended up being my #1 listened to song on Spotify wrapped)

We ended up getting back together, and we’ve been dating again for a year (4 years total minus 3 weeks last year). Thing is, even still that I know it’s in the past and it’s all fixed, just hearing the first note of the song, or the title mentioned in casual conversation, I immediately feel the rush of all that despair and pain come back to me. 

This song can almost instantly cause a panic attack for me, and I hear it more often than I would like even when it’s just out and about on the radio or playing in stores. I had to be put on PTSD and anxiety medication just to deal with daily life from how hard this song broke me.

I want to get over this. I’ve tried exposure therapy, purposeful avoidance, mental preparation, everything my therapists and psychiatrists recommended me.

In the seven years of my adult life I've been through ups and downs but it's mostly been downs. Recently though, I feel like things are actually getting better. I'm finally building resilience to setbacks and I'm actually feeling determined to get out of unhealthy patterns. I understand myself and my emotions better than ever.

I decided I'd try giving dating apps a shot a few months ago. Took me a while to build confidence to use them, but I'm getting matches now and it's providing me the promise of change in my life. But I'm extremely inexperienced in everything related to dating, all the way down to just making friends with someone. I even tend to hold back and withdraw when getting close to people, and probably the most important pattern I'm trying to break. My inexperience makes me feel like I'm not ready, meanwhile people my age are often starting to move on from experimenting and building up experience. 

I feel like I waited too long and should use the energy I have now towards making the best of the dwindling opportunities I have left. I know the right person won't care about inexperience, as long as we can hit it off. Me withdrawing doesn't make this easy though. So while I feel some rush, I also feel with every match I withdraw from or don't give my all, that I'm really just not ready for this yet. Still too much hurt and internal trouble.

1776,323,1697363915.0,Is permanent hair dye supposed to hurt?,"I’ve been dyeing my hair blue regularly for the past 6-7 years and wanted to switch to permanent instead to reduce how often I bleach my hair. So far so good, but the last time I used permanent dye— a couple months ago— it stung so bad that I was like rushing to get it out as fast as possible. For the record, it’s not like I’m sensitive to pain. I’ve gotten tattoos, piercings by hand and a couple surgeries so I’m no stranger to long periods of discomfort lol.

Yesterday, I got some more permanent dye and as I started my game plan, I decided to skip lightening. My hair is faded into a minty green at this point, but it’s still pretty light. Especially since my hair is usually medium to light brown. My roots still aren’t really visible either, so I can probably get away with it.

But is permanent dye supposed to do that? I see mixed responses and nearly all of them assume that the permanent dye is to go blonde or something. To my knowledge, permanent blue dye is still a new thing which just adds to complexity.  Some say the stinging is normal but others say it’s an allergic reaction. 

I do patch tests with this stuff and haven’t noticed anything of concern. And I don’t think it’s a chemical burn because when I rinse out the dye, the stinging immediately stops.

If it helps, I have fine but thick, medium to light brown hair. Im trying to be careful because last week, I was switched from testosterone injections to temporarily using testosterone gel. Gel is known to cause baldness faster than injections, and while both sides of the family have full heads of hair in their 60s and 70s, I still don’t want to gamble with it.

If it’s not supposed to sting, I’m going to bite the bullet and return to semi-permanent. I know people say to leave all this to a cosmetologist but I’ve tried ones in the county with mostly bad results. Whether it was damage to my skin/hair or just a bad dye job overall, I’ve had less bad experiences by myself than with people around here.

It's hard to pinpoint if it's a hint of jealousy, disappointment, or just a sense of regret. I don't know. For example, individuals like Ronen Rubinstein from 911 Lone Star, Ezra Miller, and Zach Rance from BB'16. It's perhaps similar to when a man who identifies as gay ends up marrying a woman or a heterosexual man who claims to be bisexual but never engages in anything with the same sex, constantly praising women for the sake of content (OF, J4F, Cam, etc.) for gay or bisexual men who are thirsty after them. Strangely, though, if he's straight, I have no issue whatsoever. Is this somehow related to the erasure of bisexuality? Or is it biphobia?my inner insecurities?

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Context of my situation**  
\- I'm an adult living with 3 narcissistic and abusive people - 1 parent, 2 grandparents. My parent doesn't want me to be independent so I haven't been able to leave the house in months, with no signs of that changing. I haven't been able to get a ""real job"" as none of the many I applied to actually seem to be interesting in hiring people.

\- Recently the only stray cat I was close to was killed (by accident - I feel like I should also note it that it was a grandparent that killed it not me!) and I'm in desperate need of a companion, I just can't bare being here otherwise. There are other strays at the house but they don't come near me and I try to limit the time out of my room anyways.

\- This will be my first time adopting so I'm very new to the process. The application form I filled out had lots of personal questions like the birthdays and full names of people living in the home. After applying I got an email stating they would be doing a property check. At first I thought it just meant they were gonna look up the property on google maps, but after looking up info about adoptions I understand it means they'll be coming to the house.

I have several concerns + questions presented below.

  
***tldr: I'm an adult living with abusive hoarders, can't leave the house and unemployed. Cat died so I want a companion. Property check will be done. I have several concerns and questions.***

  
**I live with hoarders**  
There's lots of junk and food sitting outside and inside the house, key guest areas are mostly presentable but from you can definately tell there's a problem.

  
Will they be satisfied if I just direct them to my organized room where I plan on keeping the cat or will they want to check inside every room and around outside?

  
**I'm unemployed**  
I make money online but didn't mention it as it's not consistent and I didn't want questions about it.

Will they have a problem with me being unemployed? We have plenty of cat food and the person I mentioned in the application works constantly. I have saved enough money to purchase neccesities, and ubers + tip to and back from the humane society if need be.

  
**I don't have transportation**  
As mentioned before they don't like my leaving the house or being independent. I live in rural country so I can't just walk.  


I'm prepared to pay for an uber but I was wondering if it would be weird if I asked if they could deliver the cat to me? I would be willing to pay them for the trip + tip like I would pay uber.

  
**I don't have a traditional vet**  
There is someone that comes by and takes the cat to the vet for free whenever we have trouble. I didn't provide her number becuase I didn't know it, my parent is the one that communicates with her. I didn't want to ask her either because she always brushes me off and would've got upset at me for even daring to talk to her.

  
I am prepared to take my cat to the traditional vet if I need to, but I'd need to save up if it costs money to register with them or whatever you do. Honestly our current situation would work out in the case of an emergency, but I'm assuming that it's not sufficient enough.

  
**Made some mistakes on the form**  
\- I made some embarrassing mistakes on the form like leaving the roomates section blank because I wasn't thinking of them as roomates I had.  
\- I only mentioned my parent because I don't know the grandparent's full names or birthdays and due to reasons above I wasn't going to ask them.  
\- I mispelled the cat's name & used a different name entirely by accident.

  
Should I just consider myself fucked or is it possible it won't come up/ will be understandable mistakes? I wonder if I'm better of going to breeder but I can't afford it.

I'm a 37 year old guy. Never had a woman take interest in me. I met a wonderful lady last year. She has put in the effort to know me regardless of my looks, etc. She sees my negatives and my insecurities, and accepts them as part of me. I really like her and want to make this work to a point that I can spend my life with her. However, things have been difficult for the last 5 months or so. We don't live in the same city. She has told me she's not a phone person (whenever we've met, I've never seen her use her phone). I've spoken to her mother a few times and her mother has the same problem with her - that she doesn't use her phone as much so communication is difficult.

Recently, She's been busy and preoccupied with various things in her life. During our early days we would talk 3-4 times a week, mostly video calls. She would reply to my texts sometimes. But these days we barely talk at all and she doesn't respond to my texts either. We did get to talk a couple of weeks ago and she apologized a lot - told me she's sick and dealing with other things and she'll make things better soon. She even said she knows I'm worried about this situation and she isn't planning to leave me/ghost me.

All of this is causing me to overthink a lot.

I see one of two situations:
1. She's not really interested in me anymore (I did make my intentions pretty clear early on that I do want this to end up in a marriage or a similar commitment. We met on a dating site after all). She was just being nice to me and continues to be nice to me, but thats all it is. I should back off and accept this.
2. Given she's not a phone person, and given she has said she's dealing with a lot in life right now, I should just continue to give her space, be patient and be there for her. If I really want to marry her, I should treat her problems as my own, and right now the only thing I can do for her problems is give her the time and space to deal with them.

I genuinely like her a lot but I feel I'm reaching the end of my patience. I've been ghosted a lot in the past and this does seem similar. However given what I know of her, and given what she's said, I don't think she's ghosting.

Long story short:  dropped out of college for a lot of reasons (it’s in my other posts, but it’s kinda NSFW).

So far I haven’t gotten any mail or anything regarding what debt I have specifically, but I have gotten emails telling me to check my student loan account stuff.  

I’m kinda just asking how long until someone finds out.  I’m not really sure how many days I have left (kinda figured I’d be doomed in September but here we are) until my parents or grandparents are notified.  There is no running away, as I’m dealing with the government or my grandparents who would hire a private investigator, and they have gone to prison for attempted murder before so…

I'm assuming the hidden text would have been 1 pixel wide, and the background may not have been a flat color, so I'm thinking that something like a light beige and a yellow might look very similar normally but the darker colors when inverted would have made it easier to separate the two?

In my reading, there is a broad range of people considered intersex between 1.7% to .02% or less. It seems like there is a lot that is unknown and also subjectivity in what is considered Intersex.

Some examples I read about are:   
A woman with an outward female appearence and genetlia but also had testes internally.   
Ambigous genetalia  
Very small penises  
Vaginas with extra large vulvas that were penis-like

1951,541,1697340628.0,Is depression keeping me from taking risks?,"I 17m am like 90% sure I have depression. I have nearly all the symptoms. I’m constantly worrying, I cry alot, I’m always upset about something, when someone is kind to me I get overattached but simultaneously think that they’re lying, etc. I’ve realized that I don’t like taking risks, I’ve never asked a girl out, I don’t like to try new things much, none of that kind of stuff. 

The people that do like stuff like that (that I have talked to) have a very positive outlook. They don’t really seem to care whether the risk is worth it or not, they do it, and if it fails then they remain happy after being upset for a day or two, then they move on to the next risk. I just don’t have that positivity, I believe that more than likely any new experience would be a waste of time because it doesn’t interest me.

1996,598,1697335936.0,Do you think society dismissed Christianity to make people weak?,"No stupid questions so here goes, i’ve been thinking about this recently. I’ve always been an atheist(?) but I do think that most religions (that i’m aware of, I am not well versed in every religion) are probably all based around things that may have happened and stories of people that may have existed and done good/ bad things although I have struggled to see the “God” side of things. 
I know there have always been issues and horrific things throughout human history no matter of religions existence but I think that I was influenced growing up to dismiss Christianity even at school I was taught about it but there was never a drive or push towards any belief which i know they can’t do at school because it’s about education and not opinion (well it’s meant to be although it doesn’t seem that way anymore) 
I feel like since Christianity became less popular that our standards of how we act as people has seriously declined. Was it the case that older people were scared of doing bad things because of God? I’m not saying that religion makes you perfect and as I already said i don’t consider myself religious at all but have our standards fallen since we dropped mainstream Western Christianity? 
And the headline question, do you think this could be a bigger thing because the only things that seem to have ever brought people together no matter your background have been money and religion. 
I watched kingdom of heaven (a movie about the crusades) and upon further research the fact that a thousand years ago so many countries were brought together to fight side by side by Christianity alone is impressive and nothing like that has ever happened since? Money is only available to few who can pay people to support them but religion is basically free to everybody and could bring people together as it has in history.
Do you think that it’s a wanted thing to dissolve mass belief in the Western world to get rid of another thing that could bond people in numbers that are concerning to the powers that be?

Probably worded that horrendously but i’ve been trying to talk to my pals about it but they don’t really have opinions except for saying “religion is a joke, people who believe a magic man made everything are stupid” It’s not relevant if any of it is true imo when i see religious people having higher standards of the way people should be.

Like smoking is way down and drinking is way down, and most adults aren’t using drugs- is it just swapping one vice for another? Like from generation to generation (previous generations smoking vs current generations eating? )

Related note- the gov and such has worked hard to curb smoking and alcohol use by saying smoking kills etc, ie stating the exact thing they way you to stay away from. 
Whereas when speaking of obesity the message is always “obesity is bad for you”(the result) vs “stop over feeding yourself”(the action) - flipping back to the smoking example, that would have been like the ads saying lung cancer kills ( and not linking it to smoking) …..

 This part I know is possible.
 Here is the part I need help with (if it's even possible to begin with)
I want to be able to control what players hear and don't hear. For example:
 the players enter some ruins and they all roll perception. Some of the players roll high enough to hear something that the other players don't hear. I could play the audio, speak, or whatever, and only the players who are supposed to hear it will hear it. Nobody knows what was needed to be rolled in order to hear this, therefore, none of players knows that another player heard something that they didn't, likewise, the players who did hear something wouldn't know the other players didn't hear it. 
I know you can mute people, but that would shut off all audio, and they know something is up, so I would need to be able to do this without muting players. Is this even possible to achieve, and if so,  how?",NoStupidQuestions,1

2079,704,1697328330.0,Is it possible that a teenager deployed an EMP on my home security system for the sole purpose of ding dong ditching my house?,"I know that sounds absurd but here’s what happened. This afternoon at 3:09 PM, my doorbell rang. Soon after, I saw a teenager absolutely booking it away from my house. Playing ding dong ditch. No big deal, we were all kids once.

As it happens though, I recently had a camera installed by my front door, which allows playback within the past 24 hours. On a whim, and mostly in the interest of testing out my new camera system, I decide to pull up the video of the kid ringing my doorbell. Here’s where it gets weird though.

I know for a FACT the time it happened. I also know the camera’s clock is set correctly. But I watched the entirety of 3:09, and there’s nothing. No one comes up to ring the bell. I check 3:08 and 3:10, on the off chance the clock is slightly off, but of course it’s not, and I find nothing. That’s when I notice something.

At precisely 3:09:13, the camera feed freezes. The clock stops, everything stops moving. A short while later at 3:09:25, it resumes and plays normally. The only possibility is that this kid ding dong ditched my house during this 12 second window. Given how fast they did it, it’s entirely possible that they were able to get in, ding dong, and subsequently ditch within this narrow time frame.

Which begs the question. Is this just the biggest coincidence ever (my cameras have never done anything of the sort before), or was the camera failure a deliberate stealth tactic by whom I can only assume is the teenage version of Jason Bourne? How is that even possible?",NoStupidQuestions,1

There were a few women dancing ten feet away, enjoying the band.

About forty minutes in, this woman (65? 70?) who'd been dancing the whole time turned around, made eye contact with me and walked over. I thought she was going to ask if I'd watch her purse. She sat down next to me, her shoulder right up against mine, and makes a comment about the music. We both sit there for a few minutes, enjoying the music, shoulders touching. She makes a little conversation, putting her hand on my arm. Offers me a sip of her beer (I declined). The band finishes, and is going to do an encore. She hopes they play Ripple.

Nice guy, taught me to do the hoop and stick game. And when I was a kid the future seemed interesting. Not nice, necessarily, we were definitely expecting some sort of holocaust, but interesting! For the purposes of this rant I’ll focus on sports. 

I used to love the DC comic Strange Sports Stories. Whether it was playing hockey against a vengeful ghost, tennis with a live grenade or pole vaulting through time, it was awesome. I also loved the game parts of Rollerball, in the way only a bloodthirsty kid who doesn’t care about social commentary can. And who didn’t enjoy watching the Harlem Globetrotters finally figure out how to beat those pesky robots?

I’m not saying that’s what i expected the future of sports to look like, but i thought new sports would be exciting at least. Instead we’ve got the dystopia future where corporations and billionaires are running everything into the ground, but instead of futuristic sports they’ve apparently decided to replace horseshoes with cornhole and something called ladderball, as if children flinging rusty hunks of iron at each other is a bad thing.  And we’ve got the wealth inequality and environmental destruction of Rollerball but Pamela Hensley is nowhere to be found and i can’t sit in a packed arena chanting “Jonathan! Jonathan!”

What prompted this post was the renovations my town has been doing to a park near my house. I thought they might be putting in a court for tennis or maybe basketball, but apparently they decided to put in two pickleball courts. And apparently it’s the fastest growing sport in America?

So there’s my question - when and why did the future of sports veer away from Rollerball and towards Wiffle-Tennis?

And another question while I’m here - why is it called Pickleball? Does it even involve vinegar?",NoStupidQuestions,1

Im a guy in my mid 20s. Back in high school I was a sex machine. I got head a lot and had sex at a very early age. Super early bloomer. Anyways, post high school everything changed. I never got a girlfriend again, and at best all I ever got was talking stages with women. Not for lack of trying. Since highschool I have tried with all my might to have any sort of girlfriend, and it has just never worked out. Friend zoning, ghosting, all of it has happened to me. All of it except for it working out.

I’m not ugly. I’ve been called attractive a lot. I have great hair, a nice smile. I’m not rich. I’m poor. But I know that rarely matters, just again giving more detail. I don’t live with my parents. I am really creative and have made some impressive creative achievements. I like to consider myself as empathetic and motivated. I constantly spend hours daily thinking on how to better myself. I work out. What I’m trying to say is I think I’d fit the idea of a catch to some people. 

Despite all of this, I am invisible to women. Dating apps don’t work for me. Going to clubs with my friends doesn’t work either. My friends (who I will add are on the same level of good looking as me if not below; I know thats a scummy thing to say but I’m just trying to paint a picture of my confusion. They’re great people. I am shorter than all of them. I’m a short guy. But I’ve seen guys shorter than me get laid.) will get all the attention while I’m approaching women only for them to walk away when I do or act like I’m an annoyance on their day. Which fine yeah they don’t owe me anything but what is driving me crazy is just that I don’t get why thats what happens. I like to find solutions to problems. I like to improve. And yet I can never fix this issue in my life. 

I will add I am mentally ill. I have been hospitalized before unfortunately. I go to therapy. I suffer from some diagnosed illnesses. Nothing reality distorting. Just depression adhd etc.

I hear all kinds of things from friends. “You overthink too much” or “you have to work on your self esteem” or whatever. That’s cool man but I try to adapt myself everytime I hear these things. Try to fix them. I listen to advice. I try to do different things. I try to fix my problems. None of it has helped.

So what is it? What is my issue? When will this nightmare end? Sometimes I joke that the universe has this rule where it has forbidden me to find a hook-up or a relationship or marriage or whatever. Maybe as karma or a joke. I don’t know. Nothing else makes sense. I can’t find an answer. I just feel like I’d save myself so much mental pain if I accepted being single as my fate. Its like having this hope that theres an answer out there is what causes the pain. If I just stopped hoping and accepted defeat then I’d stop being let down or caring. I want to stop. But my friends don’t let me. They say one day it will happen. That I’m such a doomer or pessimist. But I don’t see it that way. All evidence points to the contrary. Years of rejection. It won’t stop. I don’t get it. It gets to the point with my friends where I feel like they just keep telling me to keep going because it makes them laugh to see me continue to try. Like a running joke.

Joe has been working there for about a year. Is friendly with people around them but is not nearly as well acquainted with the boss.

Right hand (John) was not explicitly caught drinking but a strong smell of spirits was smelt as they were walking by, being the only other person in the office - as well as being every now and then quite difficult to understand, leads to believe they might be drinking at work. John exhibits on and off slurred speech and is difficult to understand, some days he speaks perfectly fine. Joe is not a native english speaker and was quicker to blame themselves for poor understanding.

I believe something like this should be reported to the Boss. Not in any malicious way, no harm has been done and it is safe to assume that this is not having an impact on John's work.
I look at this situation from the point of view of the Boss. I would like to know information like this, no matter how likely it is to be true. I would also gain respect for Joe, of course if they were to handle this tastefully.

Joe believes that this is sticking your nose into someone's else's business. They are not friendly with the boss, they find it unlikely that the Boss would not know of something like this, they work closely together and if it was a big issue it would have been known by now.

I would also like to clear up that i can't paint the full picture of how uncomfortable a situation like this would be for Joe and so I can't name any other tangible reasons to support Joe's side because there are a lot of unspoken emotions at play.

I Googled it. The idea is already taken. In fact it was trending on TikTok a few months ago.

What would you do? Continue with your perfect business plan? Or throw it away and spend another six months developing a new concept?

I started going to driving school for B category last week. It was absolute hell. I am stuck on couple things that i don't understand and no matter how much i re-read all we wrote i still can't understand it properly nor remember it. I also get headaches a lot it's literally only when I'm there. We usually are there for like 2h 35min or like 3h 30min. 

I feel so fucking stupid. I'm the only girl there, there's like 5-6 of us. I feel like I'm the only one who understands nothing. When we practice answering questions i always stay silent when answers are revealed because i realize how many mistakes i actually make and its mostly the ones others got correct. Last time i didn't even bother reading nor understanding much i hated it and felt so low. Few times the instructor (also a woman) said like ""this is harder for us girls"" or ""especially girls need to be careful"" it's like i don't care but it's humiliating why am i the only one that has to be especially careful when driving behind trucks or going around cars? 

Also when they talk about like car brands and types idk i just don't understand anything and everyone else does like i can tell you what color it is or if it's passat or citroen but that's it. Add some numbers or letters or other words? Goodbye. It's so embarrassing. 

I don't know why it's taking such a toll on me tbh it's not that deep but it is and I'm paying money for it i don't want to fail and lose it all but it's so hard i hate it. 

I genuinely don't know what to do or how to get better. I'm definitely not gonna tell if I'm wrong because I'm introverted and shy so hell no but I'm at a loss. 

What am i supposed to do? I literally have only 1 day to learn what we did in 6. Ig my best way of learning is basically re-writing everything we wrote till now but idk if i should write in a new notebook where i understand it better (i used one where i wrote it all shitty cus it was just for the beginning but i had not time to re-write) or should i after every lesson write it on my computer and print it out? Maybe i will have easier access and it'll be easier to read? Or to just use a notebook? How to even practice all this properly?

2185,845,1697317600.0,Can I report an employer having us put in fake lunch breaks and urging employees to turn in timesheets with hours before working (and then making them work over those hours) in the state of California?,"What the title says. I work once a week for a public university's law school and work 6+ hours.

As far as I'm aware, in the state of California we have the right to a 10 minute rest break and a 30 minute lunch break. My employer does not offer us a lunch break and has us work straight through, they then ask us to falsify our timesheets by adding in an hour lunch break and putting in an extra hour of work to make up for that hour of pay.

They also ask us to turn in our timesheets before we work and often ask us to log the hours 7-12..  our program always goes til 1 or later, however the official hours are to 12. They ask us to change our timesheets after the fact which is a long process (I'm assuming to delay payday)... I don't do this, I just wait and log my time after work is over.

It's a teaching job with highschoolers. They allow us to work before we have had the livescan (fingerprint scan/background check and confirmation of eligibility to work in the US) which I also believe is illegal.

We also had an incident last year with one of our co-workers talking inappropriately with a highschooler. They did nothing about the situation. It happened again and they lied multiple times saying they did something, changing the story to ""we didn't know"", ""we did something just no one told you"", ""we didn't do something the first time but the second time we did"". In the end, they asked us to no longer report these incidents as we should ""trust our boss""...

I am also getting good sleep and eating healthy.

Today i drank 3 cups of coffee after not having it for 2 weeks,i didn’t feel the energy and increased happiness like usual but more just increased heart rate if that. 

A week ago i drank 10 standard drinks after not drinking for a month and literally all i felt was a little fuzzy and more tired than usual.

Nothing bad has happened really, but I feel so, so sad (over nothing?) and see everything cynically.

  
Over the course of the last week I have very quickly lost all my motivation. I don't wanna get out of bed for anything. Nothing sounds good to me anymore. All the hobbies I was addicted to seem pointless. I used to LOVE my job now I'm about to resign because it seems stupid and I don't want to leave the house.   


All I feel like I can do is lay on the floor/bed and cry. But I'm crying without a reason, it feels so strange. Sometimes I'll watch one specific series, which makes me feel less sad while I'm watching it, but anything feels like a waste. I feel so cynical. Like it's taken me all day to write this post, I have no energy and feel like doing it is almost pointless.   


And I can't really remember anything that's happening. Like yesterday feels like a dream.

Can depression just come on suddenly like that? And without a reason? (If yeah, what should I do? I can't afford therapy or anything like that, have crap insurance.)

The whole memory of getting the tattoo is really special to me (stick n poke in a punk rock trailer in the desert in the rain with new sweet friends and a budding love story - with someone who ended up treating me as bad as it gets without killing me, but I still endear the beginning stages of that adventure). It’s a symbol of survival and also how I claimed my own power when I entered that time, and also when I walked away. However, no one in my family or friends likes it. I honestly feel insecure about it. If it were surrounded by other tattoos I wouldn’t, but it’s all by itself on my arm. Also, it’s not the arm I wish it were on. The dislike for the tattoo is palpable from my family. I know how it sounds to say all this and that many folks would tell me that it’s my body and to keep it if I like it, but my truest friends feel sad when they see it, albeit confused (and that’s ok). I hope I see the artist again because we’re friends now although in different places, and I worry how she would feel, or rather, how I feel about removing it. The artist did a good job and she did what I asked her to. I just don’t like where I chose to have the tattoo nor it’s expression (a possum with its mouth open - I thought it would b fierce but it just reminds me of pain).

What ingredient(s) should I shop for in the future that's in the 'good' wash or avoid that's in the 'bad' wash?


I usually use Dove ""Cucumber and Green Tea"" body wash, but when it was out of stock at my store the other month I had to substitute with Dove ""Sensitive Skin hypoallergenic"". The cucumber one clings to my skin long enough in the shower for me to squirt with one hand and then lather on my skin with the other hand (I don't use a loofah or washcloth, though maybe I should. that's outside the scope of this question tho). Or long enough to start lathering, realize I forgot to brace my leg on the edge of the tub, move my leg up, and then continue lathering.

But the sensitive skin one sometimes slides right off my body in that split second right after I've squirted it?? So I've had to start carefully cupping each squirt and start lathering it in the palm of my hand immediately, otherwise the glob of it often drop onto the tub floor and go to waste. It also tends more toward staying in the original squirts/globs and needs more force for me to work it into my skin when I *do* catch runaways in time.


I'm assuming one of the culprit ingredients is gonna be well-known-ish, but when I Google for the differences intra-body-wash all I get are results about the differences between bar soap and body wash 🤦‍♂️. I would maybe guess glycerine, but that's present in both formulations. So maybe soybean oil?? The non-overlapping ingredients are:

- sodium benzoate
- hydrogenated vegetable glycerides
- glyceryl stearate
- glycol distearate
- hydroxystearic acid
- cucumis sativus (cucumber) juice
- camellia sinensis leaf extract
- carrageenan
- cyamopsis tetragonoloba (guar) gum
- sodium gluconate
- alpha-isomethyl ionone
- hexyl cinnamal
- limonene
- linalool

Sensitive (harder to lather):

- sodium hydroxypropyl starch phosphate

Let's say this person turns 19, and their prescription is now 5.

We know that some individuals can only receive LASIK or PRK once in their lifetime, while others may be eligible for multiple surgeries. 

So, why isn't the surgery performed on the 15-year-old to potentially reduce their prescription back to 0? Then, when they're 19, it might not be as high as 5, possibly a 3 or less. 

I hope this question makes sense. It's been keeping me up at night.",NoStupidQuestions,1

Then he set up a ranking system for us, (the friends in the group, including me) where you start with 100 points and you lose points if you do something Adam doesn't like, and you gain points if you do something good. It's like he's a dictator or something.
I've lost quite a few points just for having different opinions than Adam as have the other friends too, and it kind of hurts my feelings.

Everyone has their own opinion on remakes, this isn't that debate, but there are animated films that are widely and wildly requested to be remade (even in live action) but because the original film ""flopped"" it's not a priority, if it's on the radar at all. My mental rabbit whole dug itself deeper when I realized that an entire industry is compromised of basically 40+ aged men and is trying to direct you to what they think is what. We've had this weird trend of a bunch of old men complaining that the avengers aren't the godfather, animation isn't ""cinema"" kind of thing and I feel like it's going to negatively influence today's cult classics going forward. 

My anecdotal example is going to be Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001). It's a huge fan favorite, and it had less than stellar reception on release and is considered a ""flop"". Despite some pretty vocal support, it doesn't appear to be on anyone's radar at all in terms of remakes or continuation. It came out next to Fellowship of the Ring, Jurassic park 3, and Planet of the Apes on the same year that the towers fell. Of course a children's movie is going to perform poorly, but that shouldn't be what's reflective of its modern viability.

If this seems like a bit of a long-winded question, I apologize. I'm just exhausted with the constant upstream struggle.

Career wise, I have little hope of staying in the same field. I work as a deputy coroner, have a master's degree in forensic medicine, and am working on a doctorate in forensic science, which are extremely niche credentials that only really apply within the American medicolegal death investigation or crime scene work, which I'm sure are different elsewhere.

Full tuition academic undergrad scholarship, 4.0GPA from high school to grad school, all the bullshit effort that goes into trying to ""follow your heart"" and make a career, and today I had to make a trip to the pawn shop and the plasma center just to make it to payday.

I don't know how someone gets out of this. I don't know whether it's the country or the whole world. I just want to get off the low part of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and I don't know how.

And even if a place like that exists - somewhere I can thrive even on a single room with a cot - I can't imagine they'd want some random American with skills only in an extremely niche and underpaid field. We're the laughing stock of the rest of the world.

I remember that my prof said that she would post the midterm grades next week. When I took it, I promise that I thought I seriously failed. I doubted all my answers.

But my stress didn't end that day. It continued next week. I kept stressing over when my grade would be posted and if I would be able to get a passing grade in the class. But she didn't post it that day.  
After the days passed, my stress increased more and more. I convinced myself that I failed so badly that my prof wanted to talk to me about how I disappointed her high expectations. I was too afraid to ask if any of my classmates got their grade. Then, she just posted all the grades after 2 weeks and I got a 95. It just took her very long to grade. Nothing else.

I live in an apartment with my boyfriend and a couple or roommates. Whenever I shower, the soap dish is just, like, FILLED with water, which has gotten all gunky and white from the bar soap in it, which I think is gross and softens up the soap,. I assumed this was the result of water just falling into the soap dish incidentally over the course of the shower, so I dump it out whenever I see it and quickly clean up the soap dish so it isn't all gunky. 


Yesterday I was showering with my boyfriend, and when I dumped the soap juice out while washing he was flabbergasted, stating, ""YOU'RE the one who's been doing that?!"" He said that the soap gunk is an important aspect of having a soap dish, and that the soapwater being there is, like, the whole point. I disagreed and said that the soap dish is just for holding the soap, and that it being full of water causes the soap to lose its shape and consistency.

2317,28,1697546298.0,My ex(27m) wants to sue me(30f),"He moved out last September. We had a daughter who was a stillborn and it completely destroyed me, him and our relationship. It got ugly, he moved out my house. He  Left his bed, couches, dressers, lots of clothes and shoes, hats etc.
Over the year we stayed in touch and would have times where we would try to work on things, have sex, go out etc. 
It turned ugly because I found out he was on dating sites while telling me we are working on things, also he'd like womens Instagram pics which is one of my pet peeves. Just alot of disrespectful shit. Anyways so we'd set up days for him to get his belongings maybe like a bag here and there, we'd always end up having sex talking etc and ""trying again"". 
But this time I moved on and he doesn't want the relationship either. 
But now he wants to sue me for money I owe him? I don't owe him money. The only thing may be that the puppy (we got together**) destroyed his couch. The dressers and bed, those items have been in my house for a year. He never made real effort to get them. Now he wants them a year later and wants to sue me. I told him he can have the dressers but the bed is staying because I've slept in it alone for a year and he bought a new bed anyways so him wanting a bed that isn't even in great condition (cause of the puppy, he left me to raise alone!) .

It disgusts me he wants to sue me because my parents actually bought him a car while we were together, my family did more for him in a year than his whole family has done for him, he lived in MY home for a year I did his laundry, cooked, cleaned, we had a great relationship while i was pregnant. He did pay half my mortage which helped  but thats expected of since he lived in MY house.
I'm just disgusted by him that he may actually sue. Idk if he's bluffing or what. 
I believe the rules in PA are he abanded his items and never got them within 30 days.
He never made attempts within the 30 days after moving out to get bed or dressers. A year ago. 
He's maybe mentioned throughout the year but our schedules wouldn't work out, he didn't have help, no storage unit yet, etc etc always excuses. And then sometimes we'd fight and I would say no I don't want you anywhere near my house but this was said 6 months after his bed and dressers were left without him living with me.

Do you think it's possible he actually has a chance to win this fight?

My sister slowly came up behind me and started to tickle me like mad. I'm one of those people who REALLY, REALLY hates being tickled. My sister knew this, but she didn't care. I kept telling her to leave me alone and stop tickling me, but she refused to listen and kept on tickling me. I'm not joking when I say this, but she would not stop tickling me for half an hour. I finally had enough. When she was about to tickle me again, I dug my fingers into both of her arms. The digging wasn't enough to draw blood, but it did stop her from tickling me again. She yelled in pain, and then I pushed her onto the floor and went to my bedroom. Our parents were out grocery shopping at the time. When they both returned, I told them what had happened. However, they sided with my sister in all of this. Both of them were FURIOUS at me. My mum even shouted at me ""YOU HAD ABSOLUTELY NO RIGHT TO DO WHAT YOU DID TO YOUR SISTER!""

most of the time i presume the worse and adjust myself on it like worst case scenario. But I don't like being be overly optimistic i wanna realistic prospectives 



Like when someone don't reply i presume i fucked up with something and overthink about that or they don't like me or whatever i know it's overthinking and social anxiety that people like me might need assurance which i don't like tbh . And i rethink over and over on what happened and revisit everything focusing on unimportant details which create sensitivity when i interact with people 


So yeah even i didn't do anything wrong i always jump to the possibility that i did something wrong or said something stupid which lead to overthinking and misunderstanding and taking responsibility for stuff i don't even relate to on my shoulders which become unnecessary burden


I don't even presume that someone hurt me at first which is mostly likely the case maybe i need to selfish abit

2478,231,1697521731.0,"Is it stupid to expect true love, and leave if I don’t find it?","I’ve been a little bit (translation: extremely and debilitatingly) lonely recently and well, I’ve been fairly confused about how I should act / what I should expect when dating. I’ve always been fairly emotionally sensitive/fragile, and I don’t think it’s healthy for me to date people if I don’t get the quantity of love I feel I need.  I’m very scared of the possibility of love dying out over time, and I really have become almost depressed at the thought that I will never find a person that will reciprocate as much love as I want to give.  

I feel like dating someone whom you have ceased to be in love with is unfair to you and to the person you’re dating, but I’m also scared if I spend my life searching for the perfect person I’ll run out of time and end up alone.  I know fairytale love is rare, but anything less seems almost depressing.  I have a need to love and be loved, not just passively, but I feel I need to be IN love. I fear that that need will forever be unfulfilled, and it’s taking a huge toll on my mental health.  So much so that I’m often finding myself crying at night, and having to distract myself from thinking about it, because the moment I do start thinking of it I just can’t stop.  

So, if I’m in a relationship and the fire goes out, is it reasonable for me to leave, even if we still love eachother?  When I hear people talk about their relationships, it’s almost always depressing.  Of course there’s the occasional one that gives me hope, like [this](https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/s4OnlapYgQ) one,  but is it reasonable to search for that type of love, even if it means giving up relationships that many people would stay in for the rest of their lives? 

I’ve made the mistake of scrolling Reddit for a few years and I’m sure the sheer number of depressing stories on here have affected my judgement of relationships, but normal love just doesn’t seem like it’s enough for me.  I feel like if the love fizzles out, I’d become completely overwhelmed by the fear of missing out on the possibility of “true love” that I would become a bad partner, and I don’t think it’s fair to stay in a relationship if that relationship will never fill your desires, the whole idea of “settling” seems so wrong to me, if you’re “settling” that means that there’s something better out there, and you’ve essentially just given up, and that is not something I would ever want to do. 

And what happens when the love does fizzle out? Especially if you’re married the way people talk about it seems like they just accept it and never go back to being in love again.  I don’t know if I could handle falling out of love with someone I thought would be the one I loved forever.

So, here’s what I want (need) and feel like is unattainable.

-a relationship where the honeymoon phase never ends (or at least where you stay in-love like the post I mentioned [(this one)](https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/s4OnlapYgQ)

-a partner that needs and wants me as much as I need them

-a partner I feel secure with, and who always has my back

-someone I can look at and no matter how bad I’ve been feeling know that my life matters so much more because of them, and that I would give anything for them.

I know people will say I am putting too much emphasis on this part of my life, but I can’t help it, it’s the purest desire I’ve ever felt, it’s unwavering, unquenchable, and all devouring.  Everything I do now, is depressing because I realize I could be doing it with someone I love. It’s like a switch suddenly flipped and I realized I’ve been seeing in black and white my whole life, but the only way to see color is to go through a lifetime of heartbreak and pain, uncertainty and anguish, just for a chance to feel the love I so desperately need to feel.  So, what the fuck do I do?  And to those who have these mythical relationships where your love doesn’t fade, how do you keep that? And to those whose love has fizzled out, what changed from the honeymoon phase that made you and your partner drift apart?

Apologies for the long post, this is sort of half because I want answers, and half because I feel like writing out my feelings helps a bit.  Also, as you probably guessed, I’m fairly young (early 20’s) and sort of trying to understand my fears and feelings.",NoStupidQuestions,1

This seems absolutely insane and unnecessarily dangerous.

I'm going to give as much context as I can here to try to help explain and see if ANYONE has any advice... 

About 3 or so months ago my boyfriend traded his old unlocked iPhone 13 to someone on Facebook for a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 (for me) and neither of us are new to the trade game but this was an experience that we've never encountered before... He checked the IMEI and serial number while chatting with the person just to double check the phone wasn't stolen and it came back unlocked and not black listed, so far so good! I met up with the lady and we both examined the phones we were going to trade and went ahead with the trade! I get home and put my sim in the phone, GREAT! The phone works great and is really amazing!! I was sooo hype!!

Well fast-forward to about a month later, (this part isn't completely necessarily relevant but some of it is and adds to the craziness) 
I'm in the waiting room with my mom at the surgery center of my local hospital waiting my turn for my outpatient surgery for 4 different issues with my nose and sinuses... I was about to message my best friend so I open my phone and it has a bland lock screen thing pop up displaying the IMEI and Serial number and that rent a center had locked the phone and that I needed to call a 1800 number or come into the local rental a center location to return their property!! The only options on the screen available were to call RAC and an emergency SOS option. I was freaking out and my first thought was IM GOING TO GET CHARGED WITH POSSESSION OF STOLEN PROPERTY 😭 I use my mom's phone to call my boyfriend he says that she never mentioned that the phone came from RAC at all!!!  While I was in surgery he reached out to the lady and she said ""oh I'm sorry the guy I originally got it from stopped making the payments because he lost his job and is in jail now"" and he reminded her that she never once mentioned that it was a RAC phone with payments (or he wouldn't have traded her) and she blocked him.... 

So I'm home recovering from surgery at this point freaking out thinking I'm about to go to jail and that RAC is going to show up any time and so I freaked and decided to turned the phone off after I took my sim card out of it and put it in my back-up phone and just put the Flip4 in the computer drawer and forgot about it.

Fast forward about a month or so later, I turn on the phone and the rent a center lock is still on the screen and I'm just not sure what to do at this point!!! I decided to put my sim card in the phone and I am sitting there debating on calling and explaining the situation to try and avoid any legal action against ME because like I said technically I was in possession of stolen property. The phone starts ringing within an hour of having my SIM card in it, and it's the 1800 number for rent a center. I'm talking to the person and they didn't ask me for any of my personal information other than my first name and my zip code. They connected me to my local RAC and I spoke to the manager and I explained everything!!  The manager reassured me that I wasn't in any kind of legal trouble and that they would just like their phone back and i was so relieved!!!  Well while talking to him he asks if the RAC lock is still on the front screen and I said yes, and he asks for the IMEI number and serial number displayed on the screen. I hear him make a hmmm noise because he was confused and he said ""well this device isn't in my system for some reason"" and he put me on hold... He came back on the call after about 5 minutes and he said that he literally couldn't find that phone in their database and that he would call around to other RAC locations to see if they had any information about the phone. Then he asked me for my first name and my phone number so I gave him that information he said he would call me back by the end of the day before they close....

About 45 minutes after the phone call ended with the RAC manager... The RAC lock screen disappears... I go ahead and call the manager back and I let him know that I'm not sure what I do at this point because the lock disappeared and he said that no one could find any information about the phone and that they were going to keep looking and he would call me back within a few days and that if it's unlocked just to keep using it since it's not in their system and if that lock comes back up to just give them a call.... He never called back...

I've been using the phone again for the last month or so with no new issues so far and I carry a back up phone just in case the RAC lock pops back up....

What could have caused the lock screen thing to disappear??? 
Why couldn't they find the phone in their system??? 
Could it possibly been charged off or something and written up as a loss on their end after so long of non payment and I just got lucky here??? 
Are there any settings on Samsung phones for the future that we can check to make sure to not end up with a phone that still technically belongs to RAC??",NoStupidQuestions,1

2520,286,1697515963.0,Why did my ex ignore me whenever she saw me today?,"My ex and I (19yo/18yo) hooked up Wednesday. Then she slept over twice: Friday night and Saturday night. She stayed at my place until 2pm yesterday when I had to go somewhere.

Today, she came to class wearing a band tee that’s mine and I didn’t know she still had. I acted surprised and told her I wanna wear it this weekend to a concert I’m going to. No response from her except a laugh. 

Normally at the end of class she would walk over to me smiling and make chit chat. This time, when class ended, she put on her headphones and walked away fast. Then whenever I walked past her on campus again she was ignoring me — didn’t make eye contact at all. Find it weird for someone who spent the whole day yesterday cuddling and watching movies with me. And kissing me even more than she did by the end of our relationship. 

She had told me on Wednesday that she would only reach out to me once and then that if I wanted to see her again, the ball was in my court. Yet she was the one to ask if she could come over again twice. And then last night I think she wanted to smoke with me and I told her we could hang later in the week. I asked her when she’s free and she said she would let me know. “Okiee ill lyk”. I didn’t see reason to text back.

2522,288,1697515844.0,If your wages suddenly changed.,"Was having a debate with my friend. It seems that the entire world is gripped with cost of living/inflation, prices increasing and wages not meeting them.

If instead of getting paid weekly/monthly and you got your entire yearly wage, once off, one of day of the entire year, and that was it, would it be easier to live off that, instead of people currently living paycheck to paycheck?

So if you earned 50-60k a year, instead of the 2-3k you get a month, you just get your entire yearly wage once off, one massive pay, logically you would then go, ok my entire years rent is ""blank"" here it is pay it, then the rest of your bills, then live off the rest... right?

I have this artwork which occurred naturally, and I feel as though some type of rich collector might find it appealing enough to pay a lot of money.

I mean, it's uncanny how picture-perfect this artwork is.

It's simply a rough cut panel/board/plank of wood. The woodgrain, for some strange reason, created an unimaginable looking copy of some sort of shark.

I worked at a lumber mill awhile back, I watched thousands of boards of wood pass by me on a conveyor belt every week. I'd see all kinds of woodgrain-images which vaguely resembled faces/objects.

One day, a board of wood came down the line and I just so happen to notice this work of art. I asked a nearby saw operator to roughly cut the image out of the board, kind of like a plaque that you'd hang on a wall. 

I now own this thing, this completely natural image of a shark. The board of wood is about 9 inches long, 1 inch deep, 4 inches wide. 
The woodgrain shark took on a dark green appearance, it even appears to have varying degrees of ""shading."" As if it were painted on by an artist. 
It's unmistakably a shark, a very detailed shark.

2583,365,1697510878.0,Is it better to call someone out or just leave in silence?,"Specifically, I've been dealing with a now former coworker who, I don't know what her true motive is anymore. She's a married woman with 3 kids.

At first, I thought she just needed someone to talk to. But I guess this became an emotional affair because of how she'd compare me to her husband. She invited me over, ""off the books"", and while her husband and kids weren't home for what I now assume was a physical affair. But I'm assuming the husband showed up cause she abruptly cancelled last second.

Since then, she became obsessive. Texting me all the time. Getting upset if I didn't text back (but it's okay if she doesn't), listening to her issues or even coming to talk to her. She even texted me, ""were you here and didn't come say hi to me?"". She's even physically chased after me on more than one occasion.

Now that she doesn't work with me anymore, she finds some excuse to text me or call me every 3 months. It's been her car breaking down, asking stupid questions about the Internet or even something marvel movie related. But she won't answer me after a while and it's annoying.

I know the easy answer is the block her. But I still physically see her because she's still involved in a way at work and we see each other at sports games.

Part of me really wants to just completely call her out. Like when she calls answer saying it's her backup husband speaking or something. But I know the passive route may be easier but she always loses her shit if I go radio silent on her.

Whether I've known them for a few minutes or a few years. Of course I won't speak on things that I may still have shame from or embarrassing stuff that if it were to ""be used against me"" I wouldn't really care.
But when I was doing this, the other party was fine but my mother got annoyed and angry that I would go to these people about it.
Now I was very confused from her reaction so I went to a friend for a little help and they said ""maybe she just doesn't want you to tell everyone your business,""
which if it had anything to do with her I wouldn't have said anything since it's not my story to speak on...But this was MY story and I was telling it to people who's been vulnerable with me and genuinely gave me good advice.
So I guess, that being said is it wrong to be open? I feel like I don't struggle with social ques and I know there's a time and a place so... Idk Im just a little confused.

in case anyone asks for specific information. 
tw; SA?
but what happened was I was 
Basically groped by a co-worker. It made me feel very gross and uncomfortable. 
I went to my mother (who works with me) and well we didn't really talk about it. She's just the type to not want to dwell on stuff like that while I need to release how I feel to other's or in general.
Well I still struggled with believing it wasn't my fault it happened so I came to these 2 older women coworkers of mine that are very open and accepting. I told them what happened and I was told to report to HR...which unfortunately I will not be doing.
They spoke to me about ways to protect myself etc and overall how to not be a naive 19yo girl 😮‍💨
but my mother took it as me claiming she didn't care because I should have came to her first about it (i did)
and then it just blew up.
I know I'm young and naive so im still learning, my judgment may not always be right ever... But my mother threw it in my face and essentially blamed me for what happened and accused me of acting too grown and giving my trust too easily.

I'm trying to get a state identification card, while being unable to visit a BMV near me (Ohio).

I've had my drivers license for 10 years but I didn't make the deadline to renew before it expired. I'm severely agoraphobic nowadays and I'm unable to leave my house. The covid lockdowns created such anxiety and stress in my life, and being unable to do anything or leave - just left me homebound. Overtime it developed into a major condition.

However, as I'm unable to leave my house, and the closest BMV is 25 minutes away - which is completely outside of my comfort zone; I'm just unable to go there. The issue arises when I can't get any online doctors to assist me because they can't verify my identity. I can't seem to do anything anymore without some sort of identity. I can't start an online business because I can't verify my identity to accept payments, I can't manage crypto because of the same reason. I can't do anything without getting a state ID card.

Is there a way, or an organization that's able to help people in my situation?

I told my boss I'm at capacity last week, and they nodded with faux-sympathy and added another massive task to my roster (urgent, of course), a task that another employee, stretched way beyond capacity, has no room to handle.

I'm even being messaged by my boss on weekends, though I don't answer.

I had read online that my company culture is terrible and that the stress of this place will be unmanageable, and I'm a cynic who always assumed companies suck ass by default, but this is wild. Everyone walks (or types, as we're remote) on eggshells around this person. It's completely wild. I feel like I'm in a TV show.

That’s lower than ALL of the monthly premiums I am seeing. And then a specialist visit could be $300-$500, but if I still haven’t reached my deductible, that means I have to pay that out of pocket, which is kind of like I don’t have insurance at all, no? If my deductible is $7,000, that means I have to see 14 specialists per year at $500 per visit before the insurance company even starts doing what I am paying into it for. That’s absurd! And I don’t even get vision or dental on this plan, so I ask, what even is the point?

I wasn't raised in a religious household, but sex was never talked about, almost taboo. Unlike most people in high school, I graduated high school having never has sex, let alone kissing anyone. So I wonder if that has anything to do with it? Maybe not really being allowed to have sex or explore intimacy as a teenager like most people do killed something in me unconsciously. I remember even after my first time, which was when I was 18 after graduating high school, the guy that I was with I was really attracted to physically and emotionally. We had sex and then I thought to myself, ""Is that it? Is that all there is?"" But I remember when I was in high school I almost had a constant hard-on. Maybe never having those desires fulfilled as a boy turned me off under the surface, but I'm unaware of it 

I've been told to try different toys, different kinds of lube, different positions, to change it up, and I have done all that. It all just feels so repetitive: in and out, in and out until you ejaculate, and the same for your partner until they ejaculate. I'm gay and I once had a guy who didn't douche beforehand and when I penetrated him after awhile I realized there was poop on my penis. That was two years ago, so I'm over it, but I sometimes do think about that. I've had sexual partners comment on how I often seem confused or disinterested or stare into space or look bored when having sex. It's odd because even with someone I find hot it's never really been fulfilling in the end. Even when I was 18 and I was new to sex, I found that I sometimes wouldn't even get erect. I once had a guy freak out that I was so young but couldn't get hard. And now here I am in my early 20s resorting to using Viagra to not embarrass myself and to please my partner.",NoStupidQuestions,1

2753,581,1697496905.0,How common are Happy Ending Massages really?,"For context, I’m a young woman who just moved to a major US city. Lots of strip malls advertise these cheap and quick massage parlors behind curtained windows with generic names like “Sun Spa” etc. I’ve had two friends who have anecdotally visited spas that included some kind of “happy ending” that they weren’t expecting.

I’m in the market for a cheap massage, but I’m seriously hoping to avoid that kind of “mix-up” altogether. This has literally stopped me from going to get one, as I become doubly convinced that the price is reflecting the additional services and not the quality of the massage itself - and that even if I do bite the bullet and say “no thank you,” it’s probably not gonna be the best massage because that’s just not the spa’s focus.

For context I’ve only gotten massages in sports therapy settings and once or twice at a hotel spa.
I’m at the point where I’m convinced that every cheap walk-in place is gonna mean I have to clarify that it’s not a sexual thing. God forbid I say something before and they’re literally a wholesome family-run spa. But also, god forbid somebody touches my butthole before I can say “no thanks.”

I (20) have Ehlors Danlos Syndrome- hypermobile type, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, Tourettes Syndrome, and a big handful of other disabilities that affect my body and mind.

I've been seeing lots of doctors consistently for years now and I always worry that I'm somehow tricking them into diagnosing me. I know that realistically I can't change my blood pressure or make my joints bend too far/pop out by sheer force of will and many of my conditions are genetic, but the imposter syndrome is always there in the back of my head.

I know it's not logical and I don't know the 'right answers' to their tests/questions to get diagnosed but doctors have told me I'm too young to have this much wrong with me or that it's ""just in my head"" which planted that seed of doubt that I'm really just faking it all.

2799,638,1697493628.0,Is finding foreigners (or mixed) more attractive than locals a normal thing?,"I've been trying to use the dating app, Bumble, and for those that don't know it, basically you'll be given a profile of someone and if you like them you can swipe right to accept and show interest and the other way around to swipe left to reject. However, if someone swiped right on me but I didn't, there's this popup that says ""you missed a potential match""

So now after happening like dozens of times, I just get this hunch of why do I not find these people attractive? For some I don't even spend 3 seconds on their profile, and immediately swipe left then I go, ""really?, I didn't expect her to have interest on me."" But I noticed I barely swipe right also because I just don't really like them and they're not my type, it's just a weird feeling I feel judgemental lmao.

I usually find Koreans to be the most attractive for me (although other nationalities too are attractive nonetheless), so is it just weird of me or is this really common on some people because I know many people are attracted to those only of same nationalities more than being with foreigners. 
+ maybe that's why I don't have a girlfriend 💀.

Some days I'd wake up at 2am, other days I'd wake up at 5pm.I had a routine for a few days, it would get disturbed, throw me into a new routine that would last 4-7 days. So I had a different sleep pattern every week. 

I'd come down and my mum would ask me something like ""Have you just woke up?"" I've had this conversation enough times to know it's not a real question. She already had the answer in her head and is just waiting for me to give that answer so we can have an argument over it. So instead of answering her, I call her out on it. Tell her she already knows what the answer is and every time we have this conversation it devolves into an argument, so why even ask the question. It replaces the initial anger she felt with embarrassment because she went in with an expectation of how the conversation was going to turn out and I flipped it into calling her out on her behaviour.

So the technique is recognising patterns in somebodies behaviour and using that to deduce what their motivation is and then instead of having the conversation go the way they planned you've used that information to flip the topic back onto them and now you're talking about their behaviour instead of your own.

We're a retail store and we open early at 7am and stay open late until 11pm for people who work different schedules, and were open like this M-F, and then 7am to 9pm on Saturday, and 7-7 on Sundays. With just me here I'm working every single one of those hours since I'm the only pharmacist and you can't open a pharmacy without me legally, so last week I literally worked over 100 hours. I can't even leave for a lunch or dinner break because one I'm so busy I barely have time to eat, and two we'd have to close the pharmacy down while I'm gone.

To make things worse, my owner thinks that since I'm a ""professional"" I need to just put up with the hours and deal with it. He thinks it's unprofessional to sit down at all while working since we're a pharmacy. There literally isn't a chair in the whole building. But refuses to buy any of those cushioned floor mats. I have to wear business casual shoes as well for our dress code since he thinks the pharmacists need to dress professionally not in sneakers or anything, so I wear a pair of ballet flats everyday.

I'll cook it on the weekend and freeze it. 

As the title says, there's no microwave or kitchen there to reheat my food. I don't mind eating it cold, but I'm worried about the safety. Even if I take my meal out of the freezer in the morning, after 6-8 hours in my bag it's going to be thawed so bacteria can grow, especially on the outside that's been warm for longer. 

All the foods I make I cook before freezing (apart from a few veggie-only grain salads maybe) and I'm a vegetarian so I don't bring meat. But I do have cheese on things like lasagna from time to time. And the casserole I made this weekend contains eggs and dairy.

  Hi there, I started working for Merry Maids about a month ago. I have 4+ years of professional residential and commercial cleaning, let’s just say I’ve cleaned some nasty places before. Which is no big deal because I love cleaning, it’s a de-stresser for me. I will start off with , Merry maids does most of their appointments online, they never go to the location to see actually how dirty a place is to give a quote. They just do it by square footage. So we are given a house that is usually cleaned once a month but we were not cleaning the main house this time we were cleaning the mother-in law house behind it. We get there and it’s on a lake, it’s a lake house. Nobody lives there but they come for vacation. Anyways we get to the mother in law house and it looks like a dog had diarrhea all over the floor, there is broken glass , No running water and huge rat droppings so me and my team mate quickly exit. We call the office they say to take pictures and that the customer will be there in 10 mins to let us in and that we can clean the main house. He shows us around for a min or too, most of the lights are still off , and it’s looks pretty clean like it would just be a simple dusting and doing floors . So he leaves and we get our stuff to go upstairs and we can see the top of the mantle is covered in rat feces. I’m appalled and mad at this point. I’m not an exterminator I’m a house keeper. I call the office and we start to notice the droppings are everywhere, on the furniture and the tables, all over the floor but it was dark and so small you could barley see. So I call the office and tell them I am not cleaning this house and pack my stuff and go back to the office. The manager is overly angry when I get back, his whole face is turning red before he even talked to me. And I told him “ you are going to talk to me with respect” and that made him even madder he was like “in my office” he goes on to say that I have an attitude and if they give me a task I need to do it no matter what. That it wasn’t a democracy it was a dictatorship and he is in charge. Also that his customers come before the employees. He then says “ if you cant handle rats, bugs, snakes and other creatures maybe housekeeping isn’t the right industry for you, if you see rat droppings you just get your portable vacuum ( the vacuum we take into every customers home) and vacuum it up”. I was disgusted by what he said and I told him I didn’t have a problem cleaning the droppings the proper way, I just wanted the proper protective gear to clean it with and for there also to be no live rats in the home running around. I don’t want to get bit and get rabies. He acted like I was being a drama Queen and told me I was fired. He then decided to give me another chance and said “so if I send you to that house tmrw are you going to clean it?” And I said “if I say no are you gonna fire me? I don’t feel constable with no protective gear” and he was like that’s it this is just not going to work and fired me. I started sobbing and left. Am I in the wrong for refusing? I read on cdc website to never vacuum droppings as you can get many different diseases from inhaling the particles from the rat droppings.

Why the hell did they make a normal shooter have basically animated sex dolls as an enemy. Like was that REALLY needed? Honestly even with the “strong” female characters that people point to looking “normal” like Ada Wong, Aloy, and modern Lara Croft still have skimpy sexy outfits. Why is Ada Wong wearing a skintight dress when she’s fighting! This also applies to people who have basically naked anime waifu stickers plastered all over their gaming setups.   When I ask this question, people respond with the classic answer of “well guys like it and they want to look at characters that they find sexy” but that doesn’t make sense to me. Why would you want to be horny when you are playing a video game. That would distract me! Do some guys NEED to be looking at scantily clad hyper sexy woman 100% of the time or they won’t be interested?  I’m not saying all women characters should never be sexy or allowed to wear hot outfits, but sometimes it just baffles me. Like the people who make nude mods for games or those “Skyrim women mod 4K super sexy face remodel” people.  Like if you do that do you actually play with the mod on? Does it change your experience that much? I just don’t get why people need to be surrounded by half naked woman constantly. I see much much less women engaging in this behavior for men.

I grew up watching tons of K-pop in my prime years. The girls were rail thin and would regularly pass out on the stage due to extreme dieting and exhaustion. It was somewhat admirable to me at my young age that one of my favorite kpop stars would only eat one Yam a day and half an apple. I would hear comments saying that anyone over 130 lbs was not considered a woman, and that girls over 5’7 did not need security at night because no one would kidnap a woman who is the height of a man. I’m seeking help currently, so the ED is not a problem, but how can I get this image of beauty out of my head? Even the tumbler thigh gaps were a huge influence on me. Is this what men really want and Can they find a woman beautiful even if she doesn’t look like a kpop idol?",NoStupidQuestions,1

2980,863,1697477132.0,Why are young adults infantilized so much these days?,"As a 23M professional adult, older adults (30+) will not take me seriously just because of my age. My employees at work seem jealous that a younger person is in charge and try to belittle me all the time. Never mind the fact that I worked my ass off in college to get into this position so I could get as far away from my Nparents as possible. I took risks and it worked out, most of my employees are aware of this from times we’ve had small talk.

 This isn’t just a work issue. I noticed people generally value age a lot, and when you’re in a position that’s considered more respectable than them, they always come up with reasons in their head why you got there. Bc of my Nparents I learned not to respect someone bc of age, but by the kind of person that they were. 

Then I look at Reddit where apparently people here think adults who are 26 are babies who can’t even cook their own food. And frankly, it’s insulting, and I truly feel like no one outside of my gf and a couple friends of mine who came out of similar situations understands this. 

I understand I’ll be more mature when I’m older, but I can tell you with objectivity that I am more mature than many people who ARE older than me.

2988,873,1697476560.0,Help!!,"  For context, my bf(24) and I (19) have been together for almost two years. At the beginning of our relationship we navigated through a lot of issues, he broke several of my boundaries I consider unfaithful/cheating n refused to ever get help for it again nonetheless ever really even talk abt any of it from that point on. He is known for lying his way out of situations with me is all I can really say. A few months ago, this idea of cuckholding got brought up into conversation. In the past before our 1yr mark, he had told me he wanted me to explore my bisexuality more and he didn’t care/wanted me to have relations with these other women. He didn’t want to be involved but at the time would still occasionally bring stuff up that i now realize sounds like he wanted to watch if I was ok with it, I wasn’t, he knew that. Whole reason I even told him I’d ever even be ok with the “poly” stuff is if I had a very strong spiritual or emotional connection wit the woman because I had no desire to go and do this to him it felt wrongful, and I haven’t even found anyone in that sense that’s made me comfortable still….besides him. Flash forward to now, and a few months back again. He kept bringing up the idea of me being wit someone else n getting fucked…seemed jus like a weird jealousy fantasy but I didn’t understand because my jealousy jus hurts me yk…I told him multiple times I wasn’t down with it. 
A.) We hadn’t been getting along all the time I wasn’t gonna do something like that when our relationship wasn’t the best anyways
B.) Id be fairly uninterested and unimpressed by men as I usually am if I was single, and I really get grossed out thinking abt it in a sex doll manner way. Some random guy tryna fuck be for both of their pleasure but not mine. Disgusting. 
C.) I was never interested in the thought of it in general im kind of a shy person when it gets to knowing me sexually and he lied about me to these people tellin em id do all this stuff to them, be ok with it, etc. he went as far as lying to me about two months ago when I saw other convos stating “I’ll help clean the both of you up afterwards in the shower” the guy was being really gay with him and I wasn’t ok with it in general…he told me he didn’t mean it like that and that he would jus help me and clean the room up but in those texts ^^^ he literally said the same exact thing to some new guy.       
I’m  so disturbed thinking about it all and him lying about it. 
D.) I told him to NEVER send these people pictures of myself. He has been. And deleting them. He told the first man you’ll see in this video named ‘Mack’ who kept asking to see my pu$$. I’m so scared he sent my pictures I’ve given him to these. He asked me for a pic of myself when we were doing sexual shit a few days before that guy asked him too. 

Whenever I found this app on his phone where all these messages were occurring, he forcibly took his phone back from me and tried immediately leaving with it. He ran all the way across town sprinted from me through streets with me trying to talk to him jus to try and get away from me to delete the evidence, well since he didn’t have wifi he ran all that way for nothing. I chased him in my bare feet just to see wtf he was doing I was so shocked he was acting like a child.

Last thing, the fact that he knows I wouldn’t be ok with it and is lying to all these people about me (I’ve been with him for weeks, haven’t seen my friends, haven’t been drunk or fucked by other dudes, etc. what he’s all claiming) is insane. He told them all he would have to wait for me to know, to already be in the room with the both of them at a hotel or somewhere far away this weekend or during Halloween as a surprise???! Doesn’t really seem like a surprise seems like he’s trying to force me in a scenario where I’d have little room to stand up to the idea of “no” possibly being trapped with a crazier man than him. I feel so distraught by all of this like it was half ass turned into some weird rapey seeming fantasy…would like to know what anyone else would do in this scenario?? Also on top of this he’s been visiting ice spices facebook page and this page for all these sports women to show off their asses n muscles n shit without me knowing. Im so ashamed dude

I don't understand the appeal of casual sex. FWB is kind gross to me, but I've seen more and more girls online proudly calling themselves FWB, or whores or sluts and the like.

They usually made me cry because they were so painful and it felt like knife was stabbing my brain. They didn't happen during the day.

 I had one at night once, and I had a soft yellowy nightlight then. Looking at it seemed to help, so I got on the floor in front of it and stared at it. The pain started to ease, and after about ten minutes, I was able to go to sleep.

At twelve, I had one, and I went into the bathroom and stared at the glaring light over the sink. Instant relief. After that, I never had another migraine again, and I'm 33.

 My parents didn't believe I had migraines, because according to them, kids can't get them. That's bull. Also, I'm autistic, and autistic kids are twice as likely to get migraines. Nobody ever believed me when I said light helped because it seems to make everyone else worse.

 Recently, I found one other person in a migraine post on fb yesterday who says sunlight helps! I'm not alone, lol! She said she never met anyone else like me either.
 
Another commenter said it must be something about my pupils retracting (Soft light= slow relief, bright light=fast relief), and she said she would try it.

I remember that my prof said that she would post the midterm grades next week. When I took it, I promise that I thought I seriously failed. I doubted all my answers.

But my stress didn't end that day. It continued next week. I kept stressing over when my grade would be posted and if I would be able to get a passing grade in the class. But she didn't post it that day.  
After the days passed, my stress increased more and more. I convinced myself that I failed so badly that my prof wanted to talk to me about how I disappointed her high expectations. I was too afraid to ask if any of my classmates got their grade. Then, she just posted all the grades after 2 weeks and I got a 95. It just took her very long to grade. Nothing else.

I live in an apartment with my boyfriend and a couple or roommates.

I assumed this was the result of water just falling into the soap dish incidentally over the course of the shower, so I dump it out whenever I see it and quickly clean up the soap dish so it isn't all gunky. 


Yesterday I was showering with my boyfriend, and when I dumped the soap juice out while washing he was flabbergasted, stating, ""YOU'RE the one who's been doing that?!"" He said that the soap gunk is an important aspect of having a soap dish, and that the soapwater being there is, like, the whole point. I disagreed and said that the soap dish is just for holding the soap, and that it being full of water causes the soap to lose its shape and consistency.

Over the year we stayed in touch and would have times where we would try to work on things, have sex, go out etc. 
It turned ugly because I found out he was on dating sites while telling me we are working on things, also he'd like womens Instagram pics which is one of my pet peeves. Just alot of disrespectful shit. Anyways so we'd set up days for him to get his belongings maybe like a bag here and there, we'd always end up having sex talking etc and ""trying again"". 
But this time I moved on and he doesn't want the relationship either. 
But now he wants to sue me for money I owe him? I don't owe him money. The only thing may be that the puppy (we got together**) destroyed his couch. The dressers and bed, those items have been in my house for a year. He never made real effort to get them. Now he wants them a year later and wants to sue me. I told him he can have the dressers but the bed is staying because I've slept in it alone for a year and he bought a new bed anyways so him wanting a bed that isn't even in great condition (cause of the puppy, he left me to raise alone!) .

It disgusts me he wants to sue me because my parents actually bought him a car while we were together, my family did more for him in a year than his whole family has done for him, he lived in MY home for a year I did his laundry, cooked, cleaned, we had a great relationship while i was pregnant. He did pay half my mortage which helped  but thats expected of since he lived in MY house.
I'm just disgusted by him that he may actually sue. Idk if he's bluffing or what. 
I believe the rules in PA are he abanded his items and never got them within 30 days.
He never made attempts within the 30 days after moving out to get bed or dressers. A year ago. 
He's maybe mentioned throughout the year but our schedules wouldn't work out, he didn't have help, no storage unit yet, etc etc always excuses. And then sometimes we'd fight and I would say no I don't want you anywhere near my house but this was said 6 months after his bed and dressers were left without him living with me.

The reason why I'm posting this is because everyone this day made me out to be an asshole. On this day, I was just minding my own business by sitting on a sofa whilst watching TV. My sister slowly came up behind me and started to tickle me like mad. I'm one of those people who REALLY, REALLY hates being tickled. My sister knew this, but she didn't care. I kept telling her to leave me alone and stop tickling me, but she refused to listen and kept on tickling me. I'm not joking when I say this, but she would not stop tickling me for half an hour. I finally had enough. When she was about to tickle me again, I dug my fingers into both of her arms. The digging wasn't enough to draw blood, but it did stop her from tickling me again. She yelled in pain, and then I pushed her onto the floor and went to my bedroom. Our parents were out grocery shopping at the time. When they both returned, I told them what had happened. However, they sided with my sister in all of this. Both of them were FURIOUS at me. My mum even shouted at me ""YOU HAD ABSOLUTELY NO RIGHT TO DO WHAT YOU DID TO YOUR SISTER!"" I tried reminding her that I was defending myself. She said that I wasn't defending myself, but I was just being plain violent. She also said to me that I was lucky that she wasn't going to ground me or call the police on me.

For example, anti-abortionists wouldn't be able to get an abortion for ANY reason including medical reasons and death since they believe that all life starts at conception and that life seems to be more important than the mother.

Why do we have to argue with one another if we can just follow our beliefs and stick to them? 

Why make blanket laws if we can just make laws that cater to each others beliefs and live peacefully together?

Edit: I just want to clarify that I'm not on either side, and I can't really argue on it much because I'm not too politically informed.

181,231,1697521731.0,"Is it stupid to expect true love, and leave if I don’t find it?","I’ve been a little bit (translation: extremely and debilitatingly) lonely recently and well, I’ve been fairly confused about how I should act / what I should expect when dating. I’ve always been fairly emotionally sensitive/fragile, and I don’t think it’s healthy for me to date people if I don’t get the quantity of love I feel I need.  I’m very scared of the possibility of love dying out over time, and I really have become almost depressed at the thought that I will never find a person that will reciprocate as much love as I want to give.  

I feel like dating someone whom you have ceased to be in love with is unfair to you and to the person you’re dating, but I’m also scared if I spend my life searching for the perfect person I’ll run out of time and end up alone.  I know fairytale love is rare, but anything less seems almost depressing.  I have a need to love and be loved, not just passively, but I feel I need to be IN love. I fear that that need will forever be unfulfilled, and it’s taking a huge toll on my mental health.  So much so that I’m often finding myself crying at night, and having to distract myself from thinking about it, because the moment I do start thinking of it I just can’t stop.  

So, if I’m in a relationship and the fire goes out, is it reasonable for me to leave, even if we still love eachother?  When I hear people talk about their relationships, it’s almost always depressing.  Of course there’s the occasional one that gives me hope, like [this](https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/s4OnlapYgQ) one,  but is it reasonable to search for that type of love, even if it means giving up relationships that many people would stay in for the rest of their lives? 

I’ve made the mistake of scrolling Reddit for a few years and I’m sure the sheer number of depressing stories on here have affected my judgement of relationships, but normal love just doesn’t seem like it’s enough for me.  I feel like if the love fizzles out, I’d become completely overwhelmed by the fear of missing out on the possibility of “true love” that I would become a bad partner, and I don’t think it’s fair to stay in a relationship if that relationship will never fill your desires, the whole idea of “settling” seems so wrong to me, if you’re “settling” that means that there’s something better out there, and you’ve essentially just given up, and that is not something I would ever want to do. 

And what happens when the love does fizzle out? Especially if you’re married the way people talk about it seems like they just accept it and never go back to being in love again.  I don’t know if I could handle falling out of love with someone I thought would be the one I loved forever.

So, here’s what I want (need) and feel like is unattainable.

-a relationship where the honeymoon phase never ends (or at least where you stay in-love like the post I mentioned [(this one)](https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/s4OnlapYgQ)

-a partner that needs and wants me as much as I need them

-a partner I feel secure with, and who always has my back

-someone I can look at and no matter how bad I’ve been feeling know that my life matters so much more because of them, and that I would give anything for them.

I know people will say I am putting too much emphasis on this part of my life, but I can’t help it, it’s the purest desire I’ve ever felt, it’s unwavering, unquenchable, and all devouring.  Everything I do now, is depressing because I realize I could be doing it with someone I love. It’s like a switch suddenly flipped and I realized I’ve been seeing in black and white my whole life, but the only way to see color is to go through a lifetime of heartbreak and pain, uncertainty and anguish, just for a chance to feel the love I so desperately need to feel.  So, what the fuck do I do?  And to those who have these mythical relationships where your love doesn’t fade, how do you keep that? And to those whose love has fizzled out, what changed from the honeymoon phase that made you and your partner drift apart?

Apologies for the long post, this is sort of half because I want answers, and half because I feel like writing out my feelings helps a bit.  Also, as you probably guessed, I’m fairly young (early 20’s) and sort of trying to understand my fears and feelings.",NoStupidQuestions,1

This seems absolutely insane and unnecessarily dangerous.

I'm going to give as much context as I can here to try to help explain and see if ANYONE has any advice... 

About 3 or so months ago my boyfriend traded his old unlocked iPhone 13 to someone on Facebook for a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 (for me) and neither of us are new to the trade game but this was an experience that we've never encountered before... He checked the IMEI and serial number while chatting with the person just to double check the phone wasn't stolen and it came back unlocked and not black listed, so far so good! I met up with the lady and we both examined the phones we were going to trade and went ahead with the trade! I get home and put my sim in the phone, GREAT! The phone works great and is really amazing!! I was sooo hype!!

Well fast-forward to about a month later, (this part isn't completely necessarily relevant but some of it is and adds to the craziness) 
I'm in the waiting room with my mom at the surgery center of my local hospital waiting my turn for my outpatient surgery for 4 different issues with my nose and sinuses... I was about to message my best friend so I open my phone and it has a bland lock screen thing pop up displaying the IMEI and Serial number and that rent a center had locked the phone and that I needed to call a 1800 number or come into the local rental a center location to return their property!! The only options on the screen available were to call RAC and an emergency SOS option. I was freaking out and my first thought was IM GOING TO GET CHARGED WITH POSSESSION OF STOLEN PROPERTY 😭 I use my mom's phone to call my boyfriend he says that she never mentioned that the phone came from RAC at all!!!  While I was in surgery he reached out to the lady and she said ""oh I'm sorry the guy I originally got it from stopped making the payments because he lost his job and is in jail now"" and he reminded her that she never once mentioned that it was a RAC phone with payments (or he wouldn't have traded her) and she blocked him.... 

So I'm home recovering from surgery at this point freaking out thinking I'm about to go to jail and that RAC is going to show up any time and so I freaked and decided to turned the phone off after I took my sim card out of it and put it in my back-up phone and just put the Flip4 in the computer drawer and forgot about it.

Fast forward about a month or so later, I turn on the phone and the rent a center lock is still on the screen and I'm just not sure what to do at this point!!! I decided to put my sim card in the phone and I am sitting there debating on calling and explaining the situation to try and avoid any legal action against ME because like I said technically I was in possession of stolen property. The phone starts ringing within an hour of having my SIM card in it, and it's the 1800 number for rent a center. I'm talking to the person and they didn't ask me for any of my personal information other than my first name and my zip code. They connected me to my local RAC and I spoke to the manager and I explained everything!!  The manager reassured me that I wasn't in any kind of legal trouble and that they would just like their phone back and i was so relieved!!!  Well while talking to him he asks if the RAC lock is still on the front screen and I said yes, and he asks for the IMEI number and serial number displayed on the screen. I hear him make a hmmm noise because he was confused and he said ""well this device isn't in my system for some reason"" and he put me on hold... He came back on the call after about 5 minutes and he said that he literally couldn't find that phone in their database and that he would call around to other RAC locations to see if they had any information about the phone. Then he asked me for my first name and my phone number so I gave him that information he said he would call me back by the end of the day before they close....

About 45 minutes after the phone call ended with the RAC manager... The RAC lock screen disappears... I go ahead and call the manager back and I let him know that I'm not sure what I do at this point because the lock disappeared and he said that no one could find any information about the phone and that they were going to keep looking and he would call me back within a few days and that if it's unlocked just to keep using it since it's not in their system and if that lock comes back up to just give them a call.... He never called back...

I've been using the phone again for the last month or so with no new issues so far and I carry a back up phone just in case the RAC lock pops back up....

What could have caused the lock screen thing to disappear??? 
Why couldn't they find the phone in their system??? 
Could it possibly been charged off or something and written up as a loss on their end after so long of non payment and I just got lucky here???

225,288,1697515844.0,If your wages suddenly changed.,"Was having a debate with my friend. It seems that the entire world is gripped with cost of living/inflation, prices increasing and wages not meeting them.

If instead of getting paid weekly/monthly and you got your entire yearly wage, once off, one of day of the entire year, and that was it, would it be easier to live off that, instead of people currently living paycheck to paycheck?

So if you earned 50-60k a year, instead of the 2-3k you get a month, you just get your entire yearly wage once off, one massive pay, logically you would then go, ok my entire years rent is ""blank"" here it is pay it, then the rest of your bills, then live off the rest... right?

I have this artwork which occurred naturally, and I feel as though some type of rich collector might find it appealing enough to pay a lot of money.

I mean, it's uncanny how picture-perfect this artwork is.

It's simply a rough cut panel/board/plank of wood. The woodgrain, for some strange reason, created an unimaginable looking copy of some sort of shark.

I worked at a lumber mill awhile back, I watched thousands of boards of wood pass by me on a conveyor belt every week. I'd see all kinds of woodgrain-images which vaguely resembled faces/objects.

One day, a board of wood came down the line and I just so happen to notice this work of art. I asked a nearby saw operator to roughly cut the image out of the board, kind of like a plaque that you'd hang on a wall. 

I now own this thing, this completely natural image of a shark. The board of wood is about 9 inches long, 1 inch deep, 4 inches wide. 
The woodgrain shark took on a dark green appearance, it even appears to have varying degrees of ""shading."" As if it were painted on by an artist. 
It's unmistakably a shark, a very detailed shark.

286,365,1697510878.0,Is it better to call someone out or just leave in silence?,"Specifically, I've been dealing with a now former coworker who, I don't know what her true motive is anymore. She's a married woman with 3 kids.

At first, I thought she just needed someone to talk to. But I guess this became an emotional affair because of how she'd compare me to her husband. She invited me over, ""off the books"", and while her husband and kids weren't home for what I now assume was a physical affair. But I'm assuming the husband showed up cause she abruptly cancelled last second.

Since then, she became obsessive. Texting me all the time. Getting upset if I didn't text back (but it's okay if she doesn't), listening to her issues or even coming to talk to her. She even texted me, ""were you here and didn't come say hi to me?"". She's even physically chased after me on more than one occasion.

Now that she doesn't work with me anymore, she finds some excuse to text me or call me every 3 months. It's been her car breaking down, asking stupid questions about the Internet or even something marvel movie related. But she won't answer me after a while and it's annoying.

I know the easy answer is the block her. But I still physically see her because she's still involved in a way at work and we see each other at sports games.

Part of me really wants to just completely call her out. Like when she calls answer saying it's her backup husband speaking or something. But I know the passive route may be easier but she always loses her shit if I go radio silent on her.

I have some common sense so im not going to just yell out ""hey guys look at me im depressed"" or so on, but if I get into a conversation and I feel as if I can comfortably speak on a sensitive topic with this person-- I will. Whether I've known them for a few minutes or a few years. Of course I won't speak on things that I may still have shame from or embarrassing stuff that if it were to ""be used against me"" I wouldn't really care.
But when I was doing this, the other party was fine but my mother got annoyed and angry that I would go to these people about it.
Now I was very confused from her reaction so I went to a friend for a little help and they said ""maybe she just doesn't want you to tell everyone your business,""
which if it had anything to do with her I wouldn't have said anything since it's not my story to speak on...But this was MY story and I was telling it to people who's been vulnerable with me and genuinely gave me good advice.
So I guess, that being said is it wrong to be open? I feel like I don't struggle with social ques and I know there's a time and a place so... Idk Im just a little confused.

in case anyone asks for specific information. 
tw; SA?
but what happened was I was 
Basically groped by a co-worker. It made me feel very gross and uncomfortable. 
I went to my mother (who works with me) and well we didn't really talk about it. She's just the type to not want to dwell on stuff like that while I need to release how I feel to other's or in general.
Well I still struggled with believing it wasn't my fault it happened so I came to these 2 older women coworkers of mine that are very open and accepting. I told them what happened and I was told to report to HR...which unfortunately I will not be doing.
They spoke to me about ways to protect myself etc and overall how to not be a naive 19yo girl 😮‍💨
but my mother took it as me claiming she didn't care because I should have came to her first about it (i did)
and then it just blew up.
I know I'm young and naive so im still learning, my judgment may not always be right ever... But my mother threw it in my face and essentially blamed me for what happened and accused me of acting too grown and giving my trust too easily.

I'm trying to get a state identification card, while being unable to visit a BMV near me (Ohio).

I've had my drivers license for 10 years but I didn't make the deadline to renew before it expired. I'm severely agoraphobic nowadays and I'm unable to leave my house. The covid lockdowns created such anxiety and stress in my life, and being unable to do anything or leave - just left me homebound. Overtime it developed into a major condition.

However, as I'm unable to leave my house, and the closest BMV is 25 minutes away - which is completely outside of my comfort zone; I'm just unable to go there. The issue arises when I can't get any online doctors to assist me because they can't verify my identity. I can't seem to do anything anymore without some sort of identity. I can't start an online business because I can't verify my identity to accept payments, I can't manage crypto because of the same reason. I can't do anything without getting a state ID card.

Is there a way, or an organization that's able to help people in my situation?

I'm back in the U.S. now, and I have a job I originally loved, but it's starting to kind of suck. I'd read some less-than-flattering things about the boss on company-review sites, knew it could be true, but took this job anyway. It's good money, I need the health insurance, and it's work I know how to do fairly well, which always brings with it some degree of satisfaction.

But recently, the boss has become ...let's just say....how they were described in company reviews online. I'm seeing how everyone, myself included, is stressed, stretched way beyond their capacity, and working to meet unrealistic goals set by the boss. Plus, we're all having tasks handed to us that are not in line with our actual position because there's no one else to do these tasks.

I told my boss I'm at capacity last week, and they nodded with faux-sympathy and added another massive task to my roster (urgent, of course), a task that another employee, stretched way beyond capacity, has no room to handle.

I'm even being messaged by my boss on weekends, though I don't answer.

I had read online that my company culture is terrible and that the stress of this place will be unmanageable, and I'm a cynic who always assumed companies suck ass by default, but this is wild. Everyone walks (or types, as we're remote) on eggshells around this person. It's completely wild. I feel like I'm in a TV show.

I would say I watch porn pretty frequently, however I find this has no bearing on my actual life, if anything it just increases my libido. 

I’m sure the affects it has are unique for men and women based on our biological and social differences. However, I really want to know why it can be so damaging for men since I can’t physically relate.

This has only happened to me once in my documentable life. I went to a diner while traveling 3 days in a row, and the food was mad greasy, so it did give me uh.. somewhat loose stools. But other than this? I’ve always just pooped like normal. The times when I do have looser stools (diarrhea is such an ugly word. I can’t bring myself to say it), it’s always due to either illness or menses. Never diet. 

I know that if your stomach isn’t used to the grease, it can affect you. But I grew up barely eating fast food since my mom was a stickler over it, and yet I still have never had my waste affected when I consume fast food.

Obviously I do not have the most income at my disposal, so I am looking at the low-premium high-deductable plans available to someone like me. 

What I don’t understand is this- I am a healthy young man who will maybe see a primary care physician once a year, which upon googling, will cost me anywhere from $100-$200 per visit. That’s lower than ALL of the monthly premiums I am seeing. And then a specialist visit could be $300-$500, but if I still haven’t reached my deductible, that means I have to pay that out of pocket, which is kind of like I don’t have insurance at all, no? If my deductible is $7,000, that means I have to see 14 specialists per year at $500 per visit before the insurance company even starts doing what I am paying into it for. That’s absurd! And I don’t even get vision or dental on this plan, so I ask, what even is the point?

Is this normal?,"I'm in my early 20s, so I'm supposed to be in my sexual prime. But I can't help but feel like sex is a chore. People my age go on and on about how great sex is, some even do stupid things or put themselves in risky situations just to have sex, but I often just sit there not really understanding what all the hullabaloo is about. I wasn't raised in a religious household, but sex was never talked about, almost taboo. Unlike most people in high school, I graduated high school having never has sex, let alone kissing anyone. So I wonder if that has anything to do with it? Maybe not really being allowed to have sex or explore intimacy as a teenager like most people do killed something in me unconsciously. I remember even after my first time, which was when I was 18 after graduating high school, the guy that I was with I was really attracted to physically and emotionally. We had sex and then I thought to myself, ""Is that it? Is that all there is?"" But I remember when I was in high school I almost had a constant hard-on. Maybe never having those desires fulfilled as a boy turned me off under the surface, but I'm unaware of it 

I've been told to try different toys, different kinds of lube, different positions, to change it up, and I have done all that. It all just feels so repetitive: in and out, in and out until you ejaculate, and the same for your partner until they ejaculate. I'm gay and I once had a guy who didn't douche beforehand and when I penetrated him after awhile I realized there was poop on my penis. That was two years ago, so I'm over it, but I sometimes do think about that. I've had sexual partners comment on how I often seem confused or disinterested or stare into space or look bored when having sex. It's odd because even with someone I find hot it's never really been fulfilling in the end. Even when I was 18 and I was new to sex, I found that I sometimes wouldn't even get erect. I once had a guy freak out that I was so young but couldn't get hard.

456,581,1697496905.0,How common are Happy Ending Massages really?,"For context, I’m a young woman who just moved to a major US city. Lots of strip malls advertise these cheap and quick massage parlors behind curtained windows with generic names like “Sun Spa” etc. I’ve had two friends who have anecdotally visited spas that included some kind of “happy ending” that they weren’t expecting.

I’m in the market for a cheap massage, but I’m seriously hoping to avoid that kind of “mix-up” altogether. This has literally stopped me from going to get one, as I become doubly convinced that the price is reflecting the additional services and not the quality of the massage itself - and that even if I do bite the bullet and say “no thank you,” it’s probably not gonna be the best massage because that’s just not the spa’s focus.

For context I’ve only gotten massages in sports therapy settings and once or twice at a hotel spa.
I’m at the point where I’m convinced that every cheap walk-in place is gonna mean I have to clarify that it’s not a sexual thing. God forbid I say something before and they’re literally a wholesome family-run spa. But also, god forbid somebody touches my butthole before I can say “no thanks.”

So now after happening like dozens of times, I just get this hunch of why do I not find these people attractive? For some I don't even spend 3 seconds on their profile, and immediately swipe left then I go, ""really?, I didn't expect her to have interest on me."" But I noticed I barely swipe right also because I just don't really like them and they're not my type, it's just a weird feeling I feel judgemental lmao.

I usually find Koreans to be the most attractive for me (although other nationalities too are attractive nonetheless), so is it just weird of me or is this really common on some people because I know many people are attracted to those only of same nationalities more than being with foreigners. 
+ maybe that's why I don't have a girlfriend 💀.

TLDR; I used Bumble but I easily reject people that're mostly same nationality as me and usually only find foreigners attractive (Asians, particularly Koreans). Is this a normal thing for some people and why I'm single? LMFAO",NoStupidQuestions,1

Some days I'd wake up at 2am, other days I'd wake up at 5pm.I had a routine for a few days, it would get disturbed, throw me into a new routine that would last 4-7 days. So I had a different sleep pattern every week. 

I'd come down and my mum would ask me something like ""Have you just woke up?"" I've had this conversation enough times to know it's not a real question. She already had the answer in her head and is just waiting for me to give that answer so we can have an argument over it. So instead of answering her, I call her out on it. Tell her she already knows what the answer is and every time we have this conversation it devolves into an argument, so why even ask the question. It replaces the initial anger she felt with embarrassment because she went in with an expectation of how the conversation was going to turn out and I flipped it into calling her out on her behaviour.

So the technique is recognising patterns in somebodies behaviour and using that to deduce what their motivation is and then instead of having the conversation go the way they planned you've used that information to flip the topic back onto them and now you're talking about their behaviour instead of your own.

We do a lot of volume and when we started there were three pharmacists to cover including me. But last week the other two have left and it's just me. We're a retail store and we open early at 7am and stay open late until 11pm for people who work different schedules, and were open like this M-F, and then 7am to 9pm on Saturday, and 7-7 on Sundays. With just me here I'm working every single one of those hours since I'm the only pharmacist and you can't open a pharmacy without me legally, so last week I literally worked over 100 hours. I can't even leave for a lunch or dinner break because one I'm so busy I barely have time to eat, and two we'd have to close the pharmacy down while I'm gone.

To make things worse, my owner thinks that since I'm a ""professional"" I need to just put up with the hours and deal with it. He thinks it's unprofessional to sit down at all while working since we're a pharmacy. There literally isn't a chair in the whole building. But refuses to buy any of those cushioned floor mats. I have to wear business casual shoes as well for our dress code since he thinks the pharmacists need to dress professionally not in sneakers or anything, so I wear a pair of ballet flats everyday.

  Hi there, I started working for Merry Maids about a month ago. I have 4+ years of professional residential and commercial cleaning, let’s just say I’ve cleaned some nasty places before. Which is no big deal because I love cleaning, it’s a de-stresser for me. I will start off with , Merry maids does most of their appointments online, they never go to the location to see actually how dirty a place is to give a quote. They just do it by square footage. So we are given a house that is usually cleaned once a month but we were not cleaning the main house this time we were cleaning the mother-in law house behind it. We get there and it’s on a lake, it’s a lake house. Nobody lives there but they come for vacation. Anyways we get to the mother in law house and it looks like a dog had diarrhea all over the floor, there is broken glass , No running water and huge rat droppings so me and my team mate quickly exit. We call the office they say to take pictures and that the customer will be there in 10 mins to let us in and that we can clean the main house. He shows us around for a min or too, most of the lights are still off , and it’s looks pretty clean like it would just be a simple dusting and doing floors . So he leaves and we get our stuff to go upstairs and we can see the top of the mantle is covered in rat feces. I’m appalled and mad at this point. I’m not an exterminator I’m a house keeper. I call the office and we start to notice the droppings are everywhere, on the furniture and the tables, all over the floor but it was dark and so small you could barley see. So I call the office and tell them I am not cleaning this house and pack my stuff and go back to the office. The manager is overly angry when I get back, his whole face is turning red before he even talked to me. And I told him “ you are going to talk to me with respect” and that made him even madder he was like “in my office” he goes on to say that I have an attitude and if they give me a task I need to do it no matter what. That it wasn’t a democracy it was a dictatorship and he is in charge. Also that his customers come before the employees. He then says “ if you cant handle rats, bugs, snakes and other creatures maybe housekeeping isn’t the right industry for you, if you see rat droppings you just get your portable vacuum ( the vacuum we take into every customers home) and vacuum it up”. I was disgusted by what he said and I told him I didn’t have a problem cleaning the droppings the proper way, I just wanted the proper protective gear to clean it with and for there also to be no live rats in the home running around. I don’t want to get bit and get rabies. He acted like I was being a drama Queen and told me I was fired. He then decided to give me another chance and said “so if I send you to that house tmrw are you going to clean it?” And I said “if I say no are you gonna fire me? I don’t feel constable with no protective gear” and he was like that’s it this is just not going to work and fired me. I started sobbing and left. Am I in the wrong for refusing? I read on cdc website to never vacuum droppings as you can get many different diseases from inhaling the particles from the rat droppings.

Why the hell did they make a normal shooter have basically animated sex dolls as an enemy. Like was that REALLY needed? Honestly even with the “strong” female characters that people point to looking “normal” like Ada Wong, Aloy, and modern Lara Croft still have skimpy sexy outfits. Why is Ada Wong wearing a skintight dress when she’s fighting! This also applies to people who have basically naked anime waifu stickers plastered all over their gaming setups.   When I ask this question, people respond with the classic answer of “well guys like it and they want to look at characters that they find sexy” but that doesn’t make sense to me. Why would you want to be horny when you are playing a video game. That would distract me! Do some guys NEED to be looking at scantily clad hyper sexy woman 100% of the time or they won’t be interested?  I’m not saying all women characters should never be sexy or allowed to wear hot outfits, but sometimes it just baffles me.

683,863,1697477132.0,Why are young adults infantilized so much these days?,"As a 23M professional adult, older adults (30+) will not take me seriously just because of my age. My employees at work seem jealous that a younger person is in charge and try to belittle me all the time. Never mind the fact that I worked my ass off in college to get into this position so I could get as far away from my Nparents as possible. I took risks and it worked out, most of my employees are aware of this from times we’ve had small talk.

 This isn’t just a work issue. I noticed people generally value age a lot, and when you’re in a position that’s considered more respectable than them, they always come up with reasons in their head why you got there. Bc of my Nparents I learned not to respect someone bc of age, but by the kind of person that they were. 

Then I look at Reddit where apparently people here think adults who are 26 are babies who can’t even cook their own food. And frankly, it’s insulting, and I truly feel like no one outside of my gf and a couple friends of mine who came out of similar situations understands this. 

I understand I’ll be more mature when I’m older, but I can tell you with objectivity that I am more mature than many people who ARE older than me.

Edit: A lot of people in these comments are making assumptions about me, so let me be clear. I work for no one. I work for myself and others work for me. I have a chip on my shoulder bc I grew up with incredibly narcissistic parents and put a lot of work into leading a well rounded life, i don’t work all the time, I have hobbies, a social life.

691,873,1697476560.0,Help!!,"  For context, my bf(24) and I (19) have been together for almost two years. At the beginning of our relationship we navigated through a lot of issues, he broke several of my boundaries I consider unfaithful/cheating n refused to ever get help for it again nonetheless ever really even talk abt any of it from that point on. He is known for lying his way out of situations with me is all I can really say. A few months ago, this idea of cuckholding got brought up into conversation. In the past before our 1yr mark, he had told me he wanted me to explore my bisexuality more and he didn’t care/wanted me to have relations with these other women. He didn’t want to be involved but at the time would still occasionally bring stuff up that i now realize sounds like he wanted to watch if I was ok with it, I wasn’t, he knew that. Whole reason I even told him I’d ever even be ok with the “poly” stuff is if I had a very strong spiritual or emotional connection wit the woman because I had no desire to go and do this to him it felt wrongful, and I haven’t even found anyone in that sense that’s made me comfortable still….besides him. Flash forward to now, and a few months back again. He kept bringing up the idea of me being wit someone else n getting fucked…seemed jus like a weird jealousy fantasy but I didn’t understand because my jealousy jus hurts me yk…I told him multiple times I wasn’t down with it. 
A.) We hadn’t been getting along all the time I wasn’t gonna do something like that when our relationship wasn’t the best anyways
B.) Id be fairly uninterested and unimpressed by men as I usually am if I was single, and I really get grossed out thinking abt it in a sex doll manner way. Some random guy tryna fuck be for both of their pleasure but not mine. Disgusting. 
C.) I was never interested in the thought of it in general im kind of a shy person when it gets to knowing me sexually and he lied about me to these people tellin em id do all this stuff to them, be ok with it, etc. he went as far as lying to me about two months ago when I saw other convos stating “I’ll help clean the both of you up afterwards in the shower” the guy was being really gay with him and I wasn’t ok with it in general…he told me he didn’t mean it like that and that he would jus help me and clean the room up but in those texts ^^^ he literally said the same exact thing to some new guy.       
I’m  so disturbed thinking about it all and him lying about it. 
D.) I told him to NEVER send these people pictures of myself. He has been. And deleting them. He told the first man you’ll see in this video named ‘Mack’ who kept asking to see my pu$$. I’m so scared he sent my pictures I’ve given him to these. He asked me for a pic of myself when we were doing sexual shit a few days before that guy asked him too. 

Whenever I found this app on his phone where all these messages were occurring, he forcibly took his phone back from me and tried immediately leaving with it. He ran all the way across town sprinted from me through streets with me trying to talk to him jus to try and get away from me to delete the evidence, well since he didn’t have wifi he ran all that way for nothing. I chased him in my bare feet just to see wtf he was doing I was so shocked he was acting like a child.

Last thing, the fact that he knows I wouldn’t be ok with it and is lying to all these people about me (I’ve been with him for weeks, haven’t seen my friends, haven’t been drunk or fucked by other dudes, etc. what he’s all claiming) is insane. He told them all he would have to wait for me to know, to already be in the room with the both of them at a hotel or somewhere far away this weekend or during Halloween as a surprise???! Doesn’t really seem like a surprise seems like he’s trying to force me in a scenario where I’d have little room to stand up to the idea of “no” possibly being trapped with a crazier man than him. I feel so distraught by all of this like it was half ass turned into some weird rapey seeming fantasy…would like to know what anyone else would do in this scenario?? Also on top of this he’s been visiting ice spices facebook page and this page for all these sports women to show off their asses n muscles n shit without me knowing. Im so ashamed dude

I know my cultural beliefs are extreme but I also suspect the girls I've been talking to represent another extreme and I don't really understand what the middle ground looks like. - in short I can't differentiate porn from reality and I'm too embarrassed to talk about this in person.

I don't understand the appeal of casual sex. FWB is kind gross to me, but I've seen more and more girls online proudly calling themselves FWB, or whores or sluts and the like. I always thought they were just promoting their onlyfans (which I also don't get but atleast I can see money as a motivator) I view these words in a negative connotation. I don't get why there are so many slutty girls out there. I've encountered more and more who do it for free. Or is there not really and I'm just biased? 

I think lots of men are into casual sex and I also think that's gross but I understand their motivation. It's the girls that I don't get. Porn to me seems misogynist and dominated by men.

They usually made me cry because they were so painful and it felt like knife was stabbing my brain. They didn't happen during the day.

 I had one at night once, and I had a soft yellowy nightlight then. Looking at it seemed to help, so I got on the floor in front of it and stared at it. The pain started to ease, and after about ten minutes, I was able to go to sleep.

At twelve, I had one, and I went into the bathroom and stared at the glaring light over the sink. Instant relief. After that, I never had another migraine again, and I'm 33.

 My parents didn't believe I had migraines, because according to them, kids can't get them. That's bull. Also, I'm autistic, and autistic kids are twice as likely to get migraines. Nobody ever believed me when I said light helped because it seems to make everyone else worse.

 Recently, I found one other person in a migraine post on fb yesterday who says sunlight helps! I'm not alone, lol! She said she never met anyone else like me either.
 
Another commenter said it must be something about my pupils retracting (Soft light= slow relief, bright light=fast relief), and she said she would try it.

As a result, their gift may have a retail value of $130 but I only spent the limit of $100. I view my budgeted spending limit as already spent money and I like buying gifts so this was how I’ve always done for store bought presents.

I recently transferred to a new school and one of my professors is a really interesting guy. He's hilarious and has a very admirable outlook on life. He talks about discipline a lot, has a ""give no fucks"" attitude, he's really intense, but everyone likes him. It's like he's what I'm aspiring to be like in the future. Also, he teaches my Electrocardiology class, so this stuff isn't relevant to his class at all, he just likes talking about it.

For example, Last Monday he felt like we were all still tired from fall break (we were). So instead of lecture he spent the entire 50 minutes of class talking about life goals and what we do after we achieve those goals. He told us about the book Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl and I literally almost broke down crying in class (last week was really hard lol). Since then I've just wanted to talk to him. Not about anything really specific, I just want to talk to him. I feel like he has a lot of knowledge and I want to learn about life from him. But he seems so unapproachable. Like why would he want to talk with me? What should I ask him about? How do I ask about life advice if I don't know what I want to know? I'm sure he's super busy too so I wouldn't want to throw off his schedule by asking random time-consuming questions. Should I even bother with trying to talk to him?

4,1697459777.0,How are ppl making home buying make sense?,"I’m in Eastern TN. Let’s lay out some numbers first. 

Salary $75,000 gross. 
Salary $62,000 net (give or take).

My question is this: how are people buying homes? I currently pay $900 in rent for a really nice 2br apartment in a very small town. The average cost for a home you’d feel comfortable living in around here is roughly $250k-$270k. Based on the research I’ve done it seems like interest rates are roughly 7% depending on a few factors. 

Doing basic math, that’s a monthly payment of roughly $1,660, and you’re paying a total cost of $598,000 over the 30y term.

The only reason we even have more hours right now is cuz corporate is sending much more inventory than the store actually needs, and the stock room is overfilled, meaning we need a large stock team working 20 hr weeks.

Having become disabled with a connective tissue disorder at a similar age to when you lost your sight I find immeasurable hope and comfort in the Marvel Netflix show, Daredevil, you consulted on. I have allowed it’s impact, and subsequently yours, to shape and hold value in my life especially in how I view my own strengths and limitations. In 2020 Marvel introduced a fan-made disabled character Charolette Webber AKA Sun-Spider with Into The Spiderverse. She is queer and has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, the first portrayal I have seen of my connective tissue disorder, as well as in combination with my orientation, in mainstream media. I suspect that audiences may have their first learning experience with the condition from this character. As I have encountered many health professionals that have not been made aware of it’s existence despite decades of experience. Although there are a dozen other characters with disabilities or mobility aids, I felt with the resurgence of Daredevil’s popularity due its emotionally provocative accuracy that Sun-Spider was able to be brought into the spotlight were representation is desperately needed. ***Where along your path did you become aware that your impact would have far-reaching implications for a broader perspective of disabled and minority storytelling?***",NoStupidQuestions

A lot of those stories seam to center around guests wearing white dresses, and I completely understand why that's a no go. However, I recently came across a story where ab afab NB person who self described as androgynous wore a dark suit including a jacket with a white blouse and getting shit from others for it. I was massively confused, since men wear white shirts at weddings all the time and it's not a big deal.

So I started wondering, how much white do you think is acceptable as a guest? My sister wore a white belt with her dress at my dad's second wedding (she was 20 at the time, so not a little girl) and nobody commented, though she did get approval from both my dad and our stepmom first. Stepmom's sister wore a dress with tiny white and blue flower embroidery on the bodice, and that didn't raise a brow either. When I went to a friend's wedding I was torn between 2 dresses, one that was green with black lace and one that was dark blue lace bodice with a white modesty layer underneath. Even though the blue lace was very dense and the whit was only noticeable up close I wasn't sure if it would be ok and opted for the green one.

He was there for a few night in the same spot and I wasn't sure if he had moved since he got there.  Well 2 nights ago, it was absolutely pouring rain and 50 degrees out.  Water was running over the little guy like a waterfall and naturally I felt bad for him, so I put on gloves and picked him off the wall and took him inside to dry him off.  He was mad at first, but when I started to dry him off with a small towel, he calmed down.  I don't really have any accommodations for a bat, so I turned off a lamp and hung him up in the lamp shade for him to dry the rest of the way off.  Then I turned off the rest of the lights and went to bed.

The following morning, he was still hanging inside the lamp shade, and before work I cracked open the window hoping he would find his way out.  I returned home 12 hours later and I heard music playing and saw the lights on.  I walked in and there were hundreds of bats having a party.  There were beer cans and pizza boxes everywhere and the place was just trashed.  I asked all the bats to leave immediately, but they all laughed and called me hurtful names.  The neighbors were pissed and thought I was crazy when I explained the situation, so I told them to go take a look for themselves.  The neighbors were astonished, but then also tried to get the bats to leave with no success, the bats even made the animal loving girl cry with their insults.

Eventually the bats turned off the music once they all were tired out, but started up again the next night.  I went over to the breaker panel and turned off the one to the living room, then closed and locked the door so they couldn't get in.  All the bats immediately became pissed and demanded I turn the power back on, but I refused.  I locked myself in my room hoping they would leave eventually, but they kept getting increasingly mad.  I heard them breaking a lot of my stuff and they have started threatening violence.  I'm stuck in my room at the moment, and I'm positive the bats can't get in, as I'm sure they're much too small to operate a door handle, but it's locked anyway just in case.

He also asserts “she didn’t want to stay”

Now my issue is in this narrative it’s all present tense. He has had no time for a length  dialogue between himself and his girlfriend.It is true she chose the protagonist but that does not mean she felt nothing for the man she was engaged too. He is speaking on her behalf when in the real time of the events which he is narrating in present tense he has had no time to speak to her making his views on how she feels biased conjecture.

The protagonist is assuming a lot of info without consulting her view.

173,1697440484.0,Do different whips have different tones/frequencies? If so what effects them?,"In my experience as a musician I would assume that every whip crack would be at least slightly different, due to rigidity, length, and/or speed, but in my very limited experience with whips, they all sound the same to me. I'm largely basing my possibilities on the guitar because it's what I have the most experience with.

Rigidity I think would have the largest effect, and more rigid whips would have a deeper tone similar to how thicker strings at the same tension as thinner strings have wildly different frequencies.

Length I think would be the next largest effect. If rigidity doesn't matter at all, then making a string longer without changing the tension would make the string higher pitched.

Speed I think would play the smallest part in any change, but with guitars specifically picking too hard can cause a string to sound higher than what it's tuned.

Expanding slightly on this, do whips have multiple harmonics in one crack?",NoStupidQuestions

But when I get the cheaper one I sometimes buy my friend one as well, and I also buy a bunch of sweets that he has some of most of the time.

The reason why is because he doesn’t have a job or much money. Doesn’t have a job because he’s not a citizen/have a work permit and even though he can find gigs, I understand the difficultly because I used to be a bum as well.

So for me $40 on him is one hour of work a month, but he doesn’t have a source of income.

Here’s the problem.
1. When he had money he was stingy towards tipping and sharing. The one thing he did for me years ago when I had no job (he got life insurance money back then) is take me on a trip and paid for everything except food. I see that as generosity but also that it was to his benefit because he wanted someone to come along.

2. He has held off on buying a year worth of Apple Music for $60. That’s $5/month. So if $5/month is that much of a loss to him, what about me spending $20-40 month just to treat him?

236,1697434235.0,Why is it normalized to interrupt people?,"Ok let me start out with saying maybe I just work with a bunch of rude people or maybe I’m a lil autistic but if I am I still know social cues. I always grew up knowing it’s rude to interrupt people when they are engaging in a conversation and just wait til they’re done or at least say excuse me before interrupting. Anyways at my job the shifts I work I’m either by myself or with another person, it’s rare there are 3 people assigned to the same area on the same shift. Anyways usually the next shifts will have a 15 minute overlap and our replacements will clock in and come to their assigned area and chop it up with the people clocking out soon. To be clear I have no problem with that and there are (very) few coworkers that actually just say hi and wait for an opening in the conversation to speak, but I hate with every fiber in my being when I’m having a full on conversation with my coworker and the next shift replacements will come say hi but not only that, but will exclude me and will ask only my coworker something pertaining to them and just start talking about that as if they didn’t see us already talking about something.

254,1697432791.0,Friend serving food on sex party - I am a bit concerned,"I am going to be quite brief as the question is real simple.

&#x200B;

So, for some time, my friend (F, mid thirties, no, not the same person) has been running some errands for one lady of the night here in the area. My friend is unemployed, toggles 4 day-jobs and lives like a student, struggling to complete her university thesis and be on her merry way.

&#x200B;

However, this particular job seem to be rather lucrative (hourly pay is great, although she works only couple of hours per week). We are talking ironing, cleaning... that sort of things.

&#x200B;

Now, since she developed really good relation with her employer, because she is literally a super person - caring, smart and GREAT looking, she eventually got an invitation to serve drinks and food on one sex party that is being organized soon.

&#x200B;

Now, since I have my fair share of life experience - it is my belief that this is recruiting.

&#x200B;

Question: Am I right? Is this recruiting? And what are some of the possible scenarios (just throw it at me, no matter how bad)? And, is there something to be done, should things take turn for the worse? Has anybody heard of or witnessed something similar? I mean, I know these are usually drug fueled parties, but... that only makes my assumptions worse. How often does catering personnel engage in activities? Are they considered participants as well? Or are they ""off limits""?

&#x200B;

So... lay it on me. And please, keep it real. I know this might awake some fantasies, but the question here is potential rescue mission of a person I hold in high regard (and have some deep relationship with).",NoStupidQuestions

The only sort of ""attention"" I got in my childhood ""TRIGGER WARNING: Sexual Abuse"" was my brother, who manipulated me into performing sexual acts for him, that made him ""happy""

Ever since having started to date, I have clinged and begged for partners to love me and want me and give me attention. Which in the current relationship I am in, feels like a big problem. My partner is disabled, dealing with alot lately, so they dont have the strength or energy to be all lovey dovey. Even though I am worried and will do everything I can and know, to support them, there is always this overwhelming voice in my head, that just wants to be told I am good, I am loved, and compliments or interest.

I got home and turned it on, I hoped on some games and when I finished I looked at it and realize how much I love that console, it was the first console in which I played online and honestly thanks to it I was able to make friends back in school, all the experiences I had began flooding in. I know it’s hard for some to understand this feeling but I couldn’t imagine just disconnecting it, putting it in a box and just forgetting about it. I know everything has a cycle but I’m just feeling like I can’t end this one. So I know I will upgrade because life evolves and so does technology, I won’t be able to play with my friends and the new stories that come in the future but it just feels weird holding my controller for the last time after 8 years together. So Reddit am o wrong or weird for feeling like this? I just don’t know who to ask because I feel it’s such a weird thing what I’m going through.",NoStupidQuestions

318,1697428215.0,How to not being absolutely exhausted after driving?,"all i find on google is for being sleepy while driving which is not my case. after I drive for more than 15 minutes both ways I become absolutely shot the rest of the day. even if I exercise I can feel the mental fatigue of being in a hyper alert fight or flight state for extended periods of time or the after effects of someone almost driving into me and willingly.

I don’t even exaggerate these things as I have had someone turn left into my car for the sake of cutting me off when I had right of way, and they did not feel even a little bit of guilt. legally they were wrong on all accounts but still tried to argue the case? and if I didn’t act and swerve they would’ve driven straight into my body in the driver’s seat.

how does anyone not get fatigued over this? I dread jobs I’m applying to that are over 15 minutes away bc I cannot stand driving but the job market is dead where I live. everything is at least 10-15 minutes away so I’ve slowly stopped going shopping, running errands, getting food, everything, bc driving makes me so sick. I don’t even make any remote detours for fun bc it means more driving. i wish I could walk or bike without risk of dying on a massive highway without an airbag.

there’s a great potential opportunity but it requires half an hour each way for just 4 hours of work and barely above minimum wage. it’s an extra 5 hours per week to being in fight or flight which is something I’ve been working to get out of but I have to build my resume.

321,1697427787.0,How does foreign aid works?,"The U.S has given about 3.75 Trillion Dollars in foreign aid since the end of WW2. This number is huge but it's still less than 1 percent  of the federal budget. For context, this is less than the amount the U.S spent (over 4.2 trillion), helping its own citizens, part of it in the form of financial in a much much shorter period of time during the pandemic stimulus packages. Another way to understand this amount, is compared to the U.S national debt being over 33 trillion dollars. But also, this isn't pennies, for example, the U.S is giving Ukraine over 47% of the aid it is receiving, and the other 53% is a collision of the EU and other countries.

 (Also, just how massive is the U.S?)  


I understand this in comparing my own circumstances, in which my ""foreign debt"" is my vehicle and mortgage loan, a huge debt, and yet, I still come to make payments monthly, while being able to allocate about 1,000.00 a year for charity, after all my expenses, and putting money towards saving. If I bankrupt one day, it won't be because that extra 1k a year I donated, nor it will make a big different in prosperity. All good so far and I don't have any concerns or opinions against U.S giving foreign aid.

But how come the U.S gives money to countries, considered allies and also some, otherwise, consider hostile? I don't want to make this about politics and I'm not going to mention U.S benefactors by country but said list, seems to include nations hostile to each other or even the U.S

This is like if I donated money to the humane society and at the same time some Non-profit organization interested in the suffering of animals, the humane society strives to help

I try to rationalize it as just ""foreign policy and influence"" but then again, some of this aid seems to be going to nations which have no interest in alliance with the U.S politically or culturally. Some would rejoice in the end of the U.S.

What's the criteria then? Because, if it was to influence, wouldn't the most important factor in regards to influence, be  that in order to receive U.S financial help, first establish a Pro-U.S government, adhere to U.S/Western democratic values, open trade relationships...etc

I just am confused. I'm not pro or anti anything. I just am hoping to get better understanding on this subject. Also some of this otherwise hostile nations don't even have oil to claim it is because of the oil.

If you wanted just chicken breasts, you had to ask the butcher for them and he'd roll his eyes at you. Sometimes on special you might find a pack of just thighs or just drumsticks, but it was not a regular item they kept in the cooler. Wings would be on a freezer shelf somewhere along with the ""weird"" meats like tripe or pigs' feet or beef tongue. (We used to buy them to go crabbing).

Nowadays when you buy chicken, it comes in a pack of thighs, or a pack of breasts or a pack of drumsticks. All the same part. Packs with all the different parts are still around sometimes, but they've gotten pretty rare.

I 26f and my partner 28 M have been dating since I was 13 years old . He is my first boyfriend, I have lost my virginity with him and experienced all the stuff you would in a relationship, with him only. 
I have no comparison as I've never been in a relationship with anyone else but I feel like he is just not sexually attracted to me anymore . 

We have been through alot in the 13 years however we have always maintained a strong relationship.  We do everything together and have been renting a house together for the past 6 years. We share our Bill's equally and never fight about money. 

Up until about 1 year ago we have always had a healthy sexual relationship . However lately I found we barely have sex anymore and I feel like we are too young to start living like the old married couple if you know what I mean. I feel like I'm the only one initiating interest all the time but I want my man to want me on his own initiative. 

Now my partner is a very anxious person who had issues with depression and has started taking antidepressants about a year ago as well. I wonder do they have this impact on his sex drive . He is better now tough and on the way to stop taking his meds as his doctor is reducing his dosage .  I understand that he is always worried about what could go wrong in our lifes but I'm starting to feel confused at what he is actually feeling for me. 

I get so little attention from him romantically that I started to fantasize about other men and this is worrying me . 

I get more attention from strangers on the street or my male co workers and that is probably starting to mess with my head . 

I'm considering confronting him about this and asking if he is with me because he loves me or he is just used to me. We are saving for a house together and all these other commitments that are life long but if we won't be able to stay in a relationship this is all pointless.

Granted, I have debts I'm trying to clear and I don't have to pay my parents too much but I feel completely stuck - i am in a better position with the debts, its manageable and a hell of a lot better than it used to be.

I want my own place, hell I even had my own place at one point but costings just don't work out.

For context:

I'm 22
I earn roughly £1600-£1800 a month, overtime dependant really.
I pay £1200 every four months for rent.

Due to having a substantial amount of money stolen from me, I'm paying upwards of £400 per month on debts, across multiple creditors and family lending me money etc.

I pay 300-400£ in bills each month.

And then I allow myself £200 leisure each month. Granted, I'm not necessarily struggling to get by, I know I'm relatively lucky in that sense but I cannot figure out a reasonable way to save up.

Even with renting, in my area id be looking at a minimum of £1000-1200 a month, unless I go down a council house route.

Adding in the debts, I immediately can't afford it. Then there's the part for the deposit.

The other side is no matter what, I always forget about some payments I have to make and end the month on practically nothing.

But she's really important to me and I really enjoy her company. Every activity is more fun with her presence. But I'm always paranoid that I'll do or say something wrong or she'll get tired of me or something.

Like yesterday we spent 17 hours straight together (10am to 3am) and I do realize that most people wouldn't do that if they didn't want to. But also, part of me is worried that I overstayed my welcome and she didn't want to say anything to spare my feelings. I'd hope that she'd be comfortable enough to tell me she's ready to call the day off and I always tell her she can kick me out whenever.

And last night, at like 2am she was like ""What should we do now? Wanna play a board game?"" which I feel like she wouldn't do if she didn't want me there? But I also texted her today to tell her I had fun and thank her for driving me home and she didn't respond but she's been a bad texter for as long as I've known her and apparently is that way with everyone.

I guess asking her directly would work but I don't want to sound insecure and I'm also worried that she'd tell me that she doesn't mind my company even if it does bother her in order to spare my feelings.

I've had americanized chinese food many times and its just not good. I never order it myself but my non chinese friends, especially white friends always seem to love it, I have a headache right now because I had some for dinner tonight. 

Usually the flavor is terrible its either way too salty or too bland. its always full of msg that makes me thirsty af afterwards and gives me a headache for the rest of the day. I do use msg when i cook myself but literally you only need one tiny tiny pinch for an entire pot of food, so why do these places dump so much msg in the food?? Also why is half of the menu sweet and sour? and who inventred chicken balls? not only does the name itself sounds gross af, the actual food itself is basically a fried dough ball with 2 tiny pieces of chicken and also its supposed to be dipped in a sweet and sour sauce. Also about the sweet and sour sauce, why is always so damn red, it looks so chemical and unnatual. The fried rice and chow mein why are they always so greasy? and the wonton soup is basically the wonton wrapper soup, the wontons basically have no filling. Can some non chinese people please explain to me why do you guys like this type of chinese food so much???

So basically, you know how there are people with no arms or with no legs?

In a hospital, you basically cut off a person's hands and legs in a professional or surgical way.

Once that person has no legs and hands, you make them blind, and you make them unable to speak (like being mute)

So you get a person with no legs and no hands who can't see and can't talk.

Now for the special part, you connect them to infusion, feeding and nurturing them.

And that's it. That person can feel, breathe and hear, but they can't move, die, communicate or do anything.

I eat healthy and stay in suggested calories but really struggle to get to a slim weight. Are slim people lying about how much they eat and it’s an unspoken rule to eat a smaller amount or are they just blessed with a great metabolism?


edits:

I don’t drink my calories! I’m not a fan of really sugary drinks/coffee, even when I was at my biggest weight my coffee was black and I only really drink water.  

In terms of being active, I’ve walked 10,000 steps a day for the last few years. It was a promise I made to myself to keep it up and it’s something that I very rarely don’t do.

The most common answer seems to be that fat people are lying to themselves which I believe somewhat to be true, I definitely was lying to myself at my biggest or maybe not even lying, just not being fully aware but I also do truly believe currently I’m eating healthy and not lying to myself. I’ve lost a really decent amount of weight in the past few years, I don’t lie to myself about how much I eat and in the last couple of months it’s just stalled. I’ve realised most people in the comments are US based so I’ll give both sizes I was always a uk size 18/20 or US size 14/16 and now I’m a UK size 14/16 or US size 10/12. I’m starting to wonder if my body is just incapable of being a smaller size. 

The main reason I ask this question is because for me to lower my currently calories I think the average calorie calculator online would deem it as “unhealthy” and too little. So I’m wondering if it’s common for people to just go into those “unhealthy” small amount of calories to lose weight but it’s not really discussed.",NoStupidQuestions

We are both adopted but our adoption stories are very diffrent. She'd tell me that my past wasn't bad because others made it seem like theirs was worse. There was a bit of a delusion problem that even she admitted to. Like she wants to believe she invented words when she obviously didnt. For a long time I tried to brush it off. I tried to pretend it didn't bother me. I knew some of it went back to her disability and how her parents chose to raise her because of it. And she also grew up with a lot of privileges that cause her to throw literal tantrums when things dont go her way. We did have good times together. And she was there when nobody else had time to hang out.  But recent events in our friend group just made it hard for me to tolerate how we exist together. I'm absolutely no angel  and have a lot of baggage I've been working on for years. One of which is avoiding hurt feelings at all cost. I told her based off recent events that I felt like we were drifting apart due to her not reaching out when a mutual friend publicly asked her to.

i like the idea of taking some time for my birthday, im in my 30s and never really had good birthdays growing up due to being poor and having bad friendships/relationships - im trying to correct this and “treat myself“ as an adult, but trying to do anything in the time frame of my actual birthday is next to impossible due to my intolerance to heat.

my question is, how do i “change” my birthday? i know i cannot do this legally, and this is not something i feel i need to pursue anyway. but all my friends know my birthday, and i would feel very weird telling them i am switching it to something like my “anti-birthday”... how do i “change” it so that the time i personally decide to celebrate and recognize it is also celebrated and recognized by friends? i live abroad, away from my immediate family, which feels like it might make it easier - i dont have to attend anything organized w/o my consent by family - but still idk how to explain to friends; for example, that yes, they know my birthday is in august but suddenly i decided it is in february! how do i “transition” folks into a “new birthday” for myself??? or am i overcomplicating it?

I've been wondering why gathered end hammocks aren't more commonly used for sleeping for a long time. These hammocks offer several advantages:  
Cost-Effective: They are much cheaper traditional beds, I got my fav one for $39.  
Space Efficient: When not in use, they take up almost no space.  
Easy to Clean: They are machine-washable.  
Breathable: Their thin material is perfect for hot summer nights, turn a fan on and you get a breeze all around you.  
Versatile for All Seasons: They easily accommodate under quilts for warmth in the winter.  
Relaxing Sway: Gentle rocking can enhance sleep quality.  
Low Installation Cost: You can set them up in almost any room without a significant expense.  
What's your take on this? I can't see any downsides unless you're wanting to sleep with your partner that night, and some hammocks you can fit 2 people in kinda. Do you have any insights or experiences to share about using gathered end hammocks for sleeping?

Help!,"In my opinion i think this is not normal as I frequently question if i am attractive enough for him or not, or whether there is something wrong with me or that he doesn’t love me anymore. A quick background about our relationship, we are from the middle east, therefore our religion and culture does not allow to go out on dates or have sex before marriage. We met on Instagram and started talking on the phone on daily basis and before we even get in a relationship we started sexting. The sexual attraction was always there from the beginning. Until finally he came to propose and we got engaged. In the beginning he was nervous even if we were alone in the car he hesitated to touch me. But when we were alone in my room its all normal and he gets more relaxed, so i thought maybe he cant do it in public (i mean show affection) not even a kiss. But when we got married and moved in together (in an apartment building behind his folks house that they built for their kids) he kept stopping me when i tried to touch him. And i am an attractive (26F) i get lucky once or twice a month. I thought its stress or he has a-lot on his mind. But this also happens when we go on vacations, we went to Italy and greece and we had sex once only. Its frustrating for me because i crave him so much.

Just recently i’ve talked it about it with him. And he told me that this is how he is and that his sexual drive is low. I tried to ask him few questions like why he doesn’t have a boner when he sees me naked? He said only animals have boners without foreplay ?!.. it gets worse whenever i ask a new question.

I 22m asked 22f in my class to study together and she said yes. Probably not a big deal to most but I’ve just started to put myself out there again.

We met last month and got along really well our first day meeting. We exchanged numbers (for academic reasons since we’re in the same group) and she said we should go eat out together sometime. Anyways, I basically texted her id like to get to know her but if she’s seeing anyone I don’t wanna ruin that…. She didn’t respond to it and then she didn’t respond to me anymore after that.

After about one full week of no contact, she sends me a message saying how her mother came from Europe and is staying with her for two weeks and she hasn’t been on her phone that much. She added it had nothing to do with me (I asked her if I did something to be getting ignored). She then texts me asking if I have the book for our class and I said yes but she didn’t ask for it. So, 8 hours later I’m like ""do you want me to share it?"" And she responds one minute later saying ""I already found it finally hahaha thaaaanks"".

I then decide to ask her to study together tomorrow and she responds by saying ""yes we can !"" And we agreed to a time. The thing is, when we met today, she was so touchy. She touched everything from my notebook to my laptop and would lean in so close to me we were like face to face and were looking in each others eyes. Truly distracting especially for me. When I’d leave and come back she’d just stare at me and ask me where did I go etc. We talked about everything and our backgrounds. 

Our convo got so deep that she cut it off with a big smile and said ""we have to study"" (looked like she was having a playful tone while she said it almost like she likes the distraction). Long story short, I saw her Lock Screen when she received a text and there was a photo of her and some guy (girls only do this when they’re dating someone) and I instantly got turned off. We ended up taking the train home together and when I completed how she speaks three languages she looked at me deep in my eyes and didn’t say anything but just smiled. When she got off she turned around to wave at me.

546,1697413624.0,Why the drive to survive?,"Now I don't mean personally or to protect your family, that all makes sense. My question is why is there the drive (portrayed or real) for our species to survive. 

My practically would suggest if we're in a dying off as a species we do the best we can and make those who remain comfortable. Often stories make it a top priority for the species to survive. Why? I'm for protecting everyone who exists. But why does the species specifically need to survive.

An example that might help. At the climax of Interstellar, Dr. Brandt gets left alone, lonely distraught, overwhelmed, with ingredients to try to seed Earth-like life and humans on a new planet, far away. They believe this will never help anyone on Earth. (Ignore the magic ending and gravity flight. Pretend things had gone as they expected.) Why is it better to do that than to stay with loved ones and do the best you can with them? In the United States, I think we usually glorify fighting, winning, surviving. There's also the Hufflepuff virtue of being there to ""die with them."" To help and support even when you're no longer free of the mess.

563,1697412139.0,Am I the asshole for ghosting my friend after he friendzoned me?,"So I have a friend that is 2 years younger than me. I have known him since 2020/2019, (he is my mom's friend's son, and they visit like twice every year) but I did not become ""friends"" with him until 2022. 

I do not have many friends. I am friends with him and his sister, and that is it. I barely get any attention from guys, at all. Like I have never been asked out or crushed on. Guys do not approach me or look at me either.
 I started to develop feelings for my friend because he was the only person that would talk to me. However he has always liked my younger sister who is the same age as him, but I thought he might have been over the crush. (He had liked her since like 2020/2019).

We had a lot of fun when everytime he visited. When he was here, me, him and his sister would have play fights. We would play video games together, go outside together (the all 3 of us) and so on. And I remember specifically that 1 night only me and him stayed up till like 5 am and played video games together. I really started to like him. 

Whenever he was not here we would have a lot of contact online, like chat and play video games. Being the dumbass I am I overshared with him (like I always do with every person that just gives me a little bit of attention). I literally shared my whole backstory, like all my insecurities, weaknesses, strengths, goals in life etc without me knowing any of those things about him. And he comforted me. 

After a while I asked him if he still liked my sister, and he said yes. I asked him why he liked her and he said it was because he thought that she was really pretty and that he misses the close friendship they used to have. 
Then I asked him why he always spoke to me if it was my sister that he really liked, and he said ""because when I talk to you I feel like I am talking to a friend or bro, but when I walk to her it feels like my life depends on it"". 

To act like I did not have feelings for him I just said that I could help him get to know my sister. I suggested him and her going ice skating or playing something together. I also made a groupchat with him, her and me in it where I was supposed to help him impress her or get to know her. 
I am not a backstabbing person, so I kept my word and helped him, although it hurt.
I was so hurt by the fact that he liked my sister, that I cried for weeks.
 I tried to force myself to lose feelings for him, which worked. I managed. I did not want to try to make someone love me when their heart belonged to someone else. 

I started to slowly stop talking to him. He always messaged me and joined me in games, but I sent him more and more short responses. I started to ignore him. And eventually he stopped trying.

Now today him, his sister and his mom came to visit. They are staying for like 5 days,  and I did not greet him. I completely ignored him. I did not try to initiate conversation, have play fights or play games like we would usually do. I did not even look at him. However I did still spend time with his sister. I spoke to her, played with her, etc. 
I noticed that he looked at me sometimes, it seemed like he was kind of sad. (Not because he likes me in that way, but because he might feel left out or like he lost a friend which he looks upon like a ""big bro"" although I am a girl.)

He tried to sit besides his sister when me and her were talking, to include himself. But I pretended like he was not there. 
Then me and his sister play fighted, and he tried to include himself. He threw a pillow at me but I pretended like it did not happen and ignored him. 
Me and his sister tried to carry each other. When she tried to carry me, he asked what I weighed (just to start conversation I guess) and I did not look at him and just said ""62"". He did not try any further.

And when I used the computer and played a game but also had my YouTube music playlist out, he came up to me and watched what I was doing. He tried to talk to me and ask what I was doing, but I did not really respond. 

I encouraged my sister to go play video games with him, and she did. 

The whole reason I ghosted him is because he friendzoned me, and I do not want to catch feelings for him again and get hurt once again. And I knew that he liked my sister, so I would not try anymore to ""earn his heart"" when he likes my sister anyway, even though we were close friends and he barely knew her. 

I also do not want a bunch of male friends. I want a male friend and that male friend would be my future boyfriend/husband, but since I know I will not have that with him I do not want to remain friends with him for my own sanity and morals. 

I feel like I am being selfish and an asshole. I mean he does not know why I am doing this. He did not know that I liked him, and it is not like he did anything wrong. He is not in the wrong for not having feelings for me and friendzoning me. It is more like I do not want to get hurt again.

Authorities have been contacted by the neighbors and the proptery owners, but I feel like more should be done.

I know for a fact they go to the local highschool and as much as I want to go there and inform the teachers about the incident, I know that there will be almost nothing done about it if I do.  The reason why I want to do this is because during my time in school I was always told that we represented the school outside of school hours. I also believe that this sort of information is beneficial for the teachers in this school. But since this incident happened outside of school hours, it feels pointless to contact them 

Should I do it or is it a waste of time?

\- One of the ppl in the neighborhood has footage of the teens kicking/body slamming their garage

\- apparently they also tried to break into someones house in my neighborhood as well

\- I worked in a school for a few months for my co-op placement and there were many incindents that happened in which I legally couldn't do anything and had to leave it as is because it wasn't some form of abuse/immediate danger or it didn't affect the school directly.

**Option 1:** The manual says to use ethylene glycol or ideally Toyota Genuine Parts Long Life Coolant, e.g. here.  
  
**The coolant in the car right now appears red**, likely the Toyota Genuine Parts version. However, this coolant requires mixing with distilled water.

**Option 3:** There's also this option to buy this which is red, ethylene glycol and explicitly mentions Toyotas 1990 and up. I can buy this at local store.

I can't currently imagine myself attracted to a real person, but I'm afraid that I'll desire a relationship later on in life and regret not dating earlier. It's akin to what people say to women who claim they don't want children, 'you'll change your mind' and the like.

To give an extreme example - the strong majority of people really disliked the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Leaks of the movies scripts came out ahead of time and people were already trashing it.

They told me they weren't going to click on the link because they couldn't verify it. I do understand that. I don't click on random links my friends send me if there's no thumbnail, so I generally ask what it is, and then depending on their answer, click/delete the link. So this person I was talking to on Tinder refused to click on the link. They then sent me their ID. I haven't verified my age or service provider on on Line app, so the only way I can search for people is by profile link or QR code. I told the person I was talking to this. They asked me to add them by QR code, so I sent them my email address. They then started questioning me about my name. I gave them my real first name. In the end, this person refused to send me their QR code via email and we continued talking on the Tinder app per their request. They told me they had been swindled out of 650,000 dollars. Supposedly, someone contacted them and asked them to invest 100,000 in real estate and this person did it. In a subsequent email with this person who they gave 100,000 dollars to, the person sent my ""friend"" on Tinder a link. When my friend clicked on the link, somehow this person was able to get into my friends bank account and remove another 550,000 dollars without my friends knowledge.

They didn't, but they started asking me of I'd ever been scammed and did I know anyone who was. The whole conversation set me on edge. I was watching everything I told them. Wishing I hadn't told them my real first name or given them my spam email account. Eventually, the conversation ended, but I felt uneasy about it.

779,1697395772.0,Has any commoner's revolution not fail directly due to the interference of foreign powers?,"I am aware that most successful revolutions have been supported by the middle-class and military powers. The two that I think of as as closest to a successful 'People's Revolution' where the lower class masses have gathered to seize power from the upper class are the formation of the Soviet Union and Hati. 

I know Hati is the strongest case because it is a slave rebellion turned, but even then the offspring of slave owners and their slaves became sort of a middle class and supported the revolution with their expanded rights, powers, and privileges. Afterwards there were internal disputes and the other nations were quick to stomp out any chance of it being inspiration to any other slave rebellions, the effects of which can be clearly seen today. 

I know these are more modern examples though and I imagine there might have been a time when a king or some equivalent was not so powerful and a uprising of the peasantry might have been successful. I understand the thought of the average person in the past was very different than today. 

The Catholic Church had a lot more power as a propaganda tool before the enlightenment period and many asian countries were either in a collection of tribes of clans where power changes hands too often to really be considered a revolution each time or the powers that be were so well established that their people were as brainwashed as the Western nations under the Church's influence.

Even if you don't use all the local ingredients the people in France used to create the dish, you could just import the ingredients directly from France. Why do people act like you have to go to the home country of that food dish to get a 100% authentic experience? If a French person, used the french recipe, and french ingredients imported, how is that not 100% authentic? Even if a non-french person made it, if they followed it how the french person did that's still 100% authentic french food in the U.S. You would just be missing the setting of France while eating it. But even that you can recreate in other countries by designing your restaurant or outside of your restaurant a certain way.

I feel like a lot of cultures are really stuck up and stubborn about their food and grasping for something to proud of their country for, because truth be told if they didn't obsess about their food their country would have nothing going on. Maybe this is a newer thing and younger generation thing? I notice that children of immigrants who desperately want to be apart of their parents culture and nationality will be super anal and gatekeeping what is and isn't authentic and what tastes good or not. I know it's obviously not authentic chinese food, but watch the chinese grandparents and their grandchildren try panda express on youtube.

I live in a blue collar, middle class neighborhood. We have street boxes in our neighborhood because about 3 years ago we were told that we had to do this based on an ""attack"" on a letter carrier. So I, as all of my neighbors, put up street mailboxes to be serviced from a mail truck. About 2-3 months ago I received a note from the post office in my mailbox (the ones that have post-it glue, colored orange) telling me I had an undeliverable package, and at the bottom it says ""dog cut off"". I went to the post office where my packages were, and questioned the counter clerk, very calmly, no arguing or being rude by me or the clerk, and the clerk politely told me that when a dog was reported, they no longer  would get out of their truck to deliver to me, if it didn't fit in the mailbox, they wouldn't deliver it. 

I then called the national USPS customer service line and explained my situation, the CSR was great, and was surprised that the dog cut off statement wasn't in her system, but assured me that she would forward to my local post office for action. Less than 24 hours later I get an email telling me:

""After reviewing the information provided, due to issues with dogs in your area in the past, your block is designated a dog cut off area. What this means is, for our carrier's safety, they are not allowed to exit their vehicle for any reason, so any parcel too large to fit in your mailbox or any item that requires a signature will be noticed and will need to be picked up.""

  
I don't own a dog. There are no dogs roaming my neighborhood, though in the 11 years I've lived here I have seen maybe 2 dog running through, with an owner in pursuit, so I can't say no dog has EVER been on my street, but those are rare outliers. So I'm literally innocent of doing anything to cause whatever has happened, and now I'm told that my USPS branch will NEVER AGAIN deliver packages to my address??

  
Please tell me if I have any recourse here. I could even understand if they said this would go on for 6 months then review, or even a year, then review, but forever???  
Thanks for reading.

  
TLDR: USPS won't deliver my packages due to a dog cut off issue, I don't own a dog, and they say this ""penalty"" will be carried out in perpetuity and never be rechecked. I'm asking if I have any recourse available to have this no delivery order rescinded. ",NoStupidQuestions

802,1697394510.0,Why do people brag about gore tolerance? Am I sensitive for criticizing them?,"Let me specify before I start that I’m talking about /real/ gore, not fictional 

Is it valid for me to be frustrated with these people? People online have called me sensitive or acted superior to me. I absolutely never go around telling people that I call losers for bragging about how unbothered they are by gore about my experience but I feel like it should be common sense to not brag about being able to stomach something you have never experienced 

When I was around 12, I saw my mom’s ex boyfriend get stabbed to death right in front of me. Before that, my brother would joke around on gore websites and make me watch from time to time. I wasn’t hugely impacted by it but I was squirmy and grossed out 

My brother was with me during the incident, he hasn’t joked about or messed with real gore since 

I mean I know for a fact that at least a large majority of people online that sit there and brag about being unphased would NOT be unphased if they witnessed something like that in real life. Especially seeing how it impacted my brother who found that sort of thing entertaining like a lot of people online do. 
It happens a lot horror fandoms. A lot of horror fans will talk about how they’ve seen so many horror films that they don’t care about real gore and just no. How. I know it cannot be because of my experience solely because I know many people who haven’t had experiences that still know the common sense on how different real and fake gore are. I’m a huge horrorhead and I LOVE fictional gore. I do sfx shit and I cannot associate fictional gore with real gore whatsoever and I know it may have to do with my incident because before it I remember always seeing fake gore and squirming so hard and imagining it as real but it was still always missing that feeling. After seeing the real thing, no matter how realistic it looks on screen I just don’t think about it in any real sense 

It’s nothing about the gore itself that makes real shit hard to stomach. It’s the dreadful aura and feeling of someone before they’re about to die that makes it disturbing and I genuinely don’t know how someone could go about being “unphased” with something like that considering its something I felt in those videos even before the incident. And why someone would want to brag if they were because they obviously have some issue if they are. The core thing that frustrates me is when people act like it’s something that makes them better. Like how I mentioned a lot of horror fans try to act superior to others for being unbothered by it.

I try to look at it from a perspective of some people find it “entertaining” to watch gore due to their interest in the human body. But that makes absolutely no sense considering there’s such a massive and more DETAILED variety that actually educates and most of the videos they watch are like 3 pixels",NoStupidQuestions

He says shaking the pictures is completely unnecessary, that Kodak never told consumers to shake the pictures, and that no Kodak publication, user's manual, or website has ever instructed consumers to shake the camera. They have no idea why people do it or how it started.

Then the exec says the company sent reps to other countries to see if they have different Polaroid developing rituals and gives examples of what they found:

In (some country, I forgot which one) people sit on the picture for several hours.

In (some other country) people put the photo on the top shelf of a bookshelf and wait for it to develop overnight

In (yet another country) people attach the picture to the foot of a migratory bird. They believe if the bird returns with the developed picture 6-8 months later, then it was a good picture.",NoStupidQuestions

Like, it’s the same thing as an animal killing another animal. We don’t apply the same morals to animals that we do humans because they have no way of understanding human moral dilemmas.

909,1697385426.0,Why do so many people not have health insurance?,"Before I start, I want to make sure you know that I'm genuinely ignorant and confused, but I also recognize that I come from a fairly upper middle class background. I'm not going to judge it anything here, I just genuinely want to learn and broaden my world view. 

I see numerous posts on reddit talking about how expensive medical care is and how they are now in debt for thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. This is normally followed up by discussion of how bad America's medical system is, and act like these bills are the norm for anyone with health issues. 

But my question is, why ain't these people have health insurance? I was under the impression that full time employers must provide health insurance or pay a fairly hefty fee every year. For those who can't work full time, Medicare is usually available as well.

So, what am I missing here? Is this actually as common as reddit makes it seem, or am I just falling victim to karma farmers?",NoStupidQuestions

914,1697385051.0,Was is flirting etiquette?,"My whole life I’ve been taught by women, teachers, and online culture that I need to… I guess be careful when I talk to women? Sparingly talk to women? Idk it was never really clear.

I was kind of told it’s not ok to flirt with women because it’s sexual harassment or I’m making people uncomfortable. I’ve been also told the worst places to do it are at school, work, bars, and if I see a woman enjoying being out on her own anywhere, I also shouldn’t really bother her by flirting.

So I don’t really know what to do. I kind of just wait for them to say or start something because I don’t want to be a bad person or seen as creepy or overbearing. 

I also don’t know when it’s appropriate to touch them. Again I’ve always waited for them to do that. 

I’ve had long terms relationships. Upwards of 5 years. And at the start of each I would make sure not to even sit on the same couch as them because Im afraid they’d feel uncomfortable like I’ve always been told.

And as a single person idk if I’m flirting with someone or their just being friendly. Idk if I’m aloud to gently touch them here and there to show some slight physical intimacy. Like something as small as holding their back gently while walking through crowds. Or giving them a cute shove when they say something goofy or funny. Or holding their hand to compliment their nails or bracelet. 

And kissing is out of the question. I won’t do it until they straight up ask me. 

The risk of being a bad person is way greater then the reward of someone by chance being into me. 

So what’s the etiquette? How are you supposed to flirt? When is it ok to talk to women? When is it overdoing it? What should my expectations be? Should I just be friendly and wait for them to initiate something? Is it sexual harassment and I should just take the risk? What’s the line between friendly and intimate?

How flirt? Haha",NoStupidQuestions

I'm 23 years old and have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and lately I've been thinking I might have some mild psychosis too. I'm saying this because most of the time my thoughts drift away from what's real and sometimes no longer know what is the true thinking way. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist but most of the medication didn't work and therapy... Well... It didn't work that well either. I want to ask you a question about one part of my problems.  
  
I'm actually a normal person with most of the stuff in life but when it comes to relationships I just lose my mind and don't know & think what to do. What do I mean by this? I had 2 girlfriends until now. When I was 16 and 21. The first one didn't last longer. The second one lasted for 1,5 years. And now I can't find anybody else. And I'm thinking about the possibility of not being able to find a girlfriend for the rest of my life or a very long time like 5 years, 10 years, 15 years... This thought is driving me crazy and it's making me lose connection with the reality. I no longer can think properly. I'm thinking about all those worst case scenarios where being single forever or ""What if I'll never find anybody else?"", ""What if I'm unlucky or there's a spell over me that's gonna make it impossible for me to find another one?"", ""What if this?"", ""What if that?""...  
  
Having a girlfriend means a lot to me. I guess this is why I'm having these thoughts. I try to think like a normal person but it doesn't work:  
  
\- ""Of course I'll find somebody else. Everybody does.""  
\- ""I just need to get socialize, meet with people.""  
\- ""Nobody knows the future. It's very uncertain. I have to focus on now.""  
  
NO. Sadly these kind of ways of thinking don't help me at all. I have intolerance towards uncertainty and it's making me suffer a lot and I can't get that idea of being single forever out of my mind.   
  
English is my second language. I tried to do my best while writing. If there are some mistakes I'm sorry in advance.

**In short, my problem is that I'm afraid of the possibility of not getting another girlfriend. Is this possible?**

For like 15 years he's been a ""parent helper"" at the school, going in to paint sets for the high school plays and do all kinds of other stuff, band booster, basketball Dad, lots of things.  Every teacher in the place knows him (it's a small school and all four of his kids went there).

He no longer has any kids at the school, but some of the kids there are friends of his daughter who just graduated, and he's still friends with the other parents. The fall play is coming up, and so one of the other Drama Club Parents asked if he would be back to help out.  He said sure, and then the school board came up with like a dozen forms he has to fill out.  Proof of covid vaccination and some others, well, fine, but they never asked before.  And they want him to get fingerprinted and have a background check.

He thinks that's idiotic; he's been at the school longer than several of the school board members have been office.  And then we got to wondering: does taking all these fingerprints really have any positive effect on student safety, or is this just a way to funnel a bunch of money to companies that do background checks?

One point for him is that he has never been fingerprinted.  His prints aren't in any database anywhere.  If he does this, now they will be, and that's bothering him.  I told him it's no big deal; I had a job with a security clearance once and I'd been fingerprinted and had a background check.  He replied by mentioning cases where people were wrongly accused or convicted of crimes because a fingerprint at a crime scene was incorrectly matched with their fingerprint, which can only happen if your fingerprint is in a database somewhere.  Sure, it's rare (but maybe not as rare as we hope it is), but it does happen.

Then I got to thinking about how after 9/11 the government went bonkers with spying on everybody, spending billions of dollars to no good purpose, and never actually catching a single actual terrorist.  Is this another case like that?  Is there any actual evidence that fingerprinting everybody all the time genuinely works to prevent crimes?  Have any actual bad guys been kept out of Band Boosters because of fingerprints?  Or is this just more Security Theater?",NoStupidQuestions

Is this normal and does anyone relate? If not then what’s wrong with me?",NoStupidQuestions
978,1697379284.0,Can you grow big from lifting small weights but in many reps,"  
I've noticed when I do small weights but ten times the amount of reps I'd normally do with heavy weight that my pump is much more amazing but the problem is when it finishes I go back to how I was before the workout. So I'm wondering if I should persist with the small weights and that I'll grow big later or I should just keep to the heavy weights.",NoStupidQuestions

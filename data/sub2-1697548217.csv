But I knew the 49ners were called the 49ners because of the San Francisco Gold Rush in 1849. This is something I learned back in 3rd grade. My reading teacher told us that. 

I remember in 9th grade, my classmate wanted to prove that I didn't anything about NFL. He is an expert, but chose to ask me why the 49ners are called the 49ners question. 

I proudly told him that is so easy and I mentioned the Gold Rush. But don't most Americans know that? I am unsure why he thought that was so unknown.",NoStupidQuestions

I coordinate some volunteers most of which are women. Usually, when they finish a project, I bring them flowers to thank them for their time (usually about $10-$15).

6,1697547701.0,How do students avoid and reduce stress related to their grade?,"I am guessing this happens to all, but I have no idea how to stop it for me. I constantly stress over future tests, but also when the grade will be posted.  
I remember that my prof said that she would post the midterm grades next week. When I took it, I promise that I thought I seriously failed. I doubted all my answers.

But my stress didn't end that day. It continued next week. I kept stressing over when my grade would be posted and if I would be able to get a passing grade in the class. But she didn't post it that day.  
After the days passed, my stress increased more and more. I convinced myself that I failed so badly that my prof wanted to talk to me about how I disappointed her high expectations. I was too afraid to ask if any of my classmates got their grade. Then, she just posted all the grades after 2 weeks and I got a 95. It just took her very long to grade. Nothing else.

The biggest problem is this stress happens in other classes as well. I hate school semesters because my stress levels are always going up, down, and up again until school semester end. I cannot wait to graduate and never go back.

18,1697546635.0,Is a soap dish supposed to have water in it?,"Okay, this is so minor but I HAVE to know. 

I live in an apartment with my boyfriend and a couple or roommates. Whenever I shower, the soap dish is just, like, FILLED with water, which has gotten all gunky and white from the bar soap in it, which I think is gross and softens up the soap,. I assumed this was the result of water just falling into the soap dish incidentally over the course of the shower, so I dump it out whenever I see it and quickly clean up the soap dish so it isn't all gunky. 


Yesterday I was showering with my boyfriend, and when I dumped the soap juice out while washing he was flabbergasted, stating, ""YOU'RE the one who's been doing that?!"" He said that the soap gunk is an important aspect of having a soap dish, and that the soapwater being there is, like, the whole point. I disagreed and said that the soap dish is just for holding the soap, and that it being full of water causes the soap to lose its shape and consistency.

28,1697546298.0,My ex(27m) wants to sue me(30f),"He moved out last September. We had a daughter who was a stillborn and it completely destroyed me, him and our relationship. It got ugly, he moved out my house. He  Left his bed, couches, dressers, lots of clothes and shoes, hats etc.
Over the year we stayed in touch and would have times where we would try to work on things, have sex, go out etc. 
It turned ugly because I found out he was on dating sites while telling me we are working on things, also he'd like womens Instagram pics which is one of my pet peeves. Just alot of disrespectful shit. Anyways so we'd set up days for him to get his belongings maybe like a bag here and there, we'd always end up having sex talking etc and ""trying again"". 
But this time I moved on and he doesn't want the relationship either. 
But now he wants to sue me for money I owe him? I don't owe him money. The only thing may be that the puppy (we got together**) destroyed his couch. The dressers and bed, those items have been in my house for a year. He never made real effort to get them. Now he wants them a year later and wants to sue me. I told him he can have the dressers but the bed is staying because I've slept in it alone for a year and he bought a new bed anyways so him wanting a bed that isn't even in great condition (cause of the puppy, he left me to raise alone!) .

It disgusts me he wants to sue me because my parents actually bought him a car while we were together, my family did more for him in a year than his whole family has done for him, he lived in MY home for a year I did his laundry, cooked, cleaned, we had a great relationship while i was pregnant. He did pay half my mortage which helped  but thats expected of since he lived in MY house.
I'm just disgusted by him that he may actually sue. Idk if he's bluffing or what. 
I believe the rules in PA are he abanded his items and never got them within 30 days.
He never made attempts within the 30 days after moving out to get bed or dressers. A year ago. 
He's maybe mentioned throughout the year but our schedules wouldn't work out, he didn't have help, no storage unit yet, etc etc always excuses. And then sometimes we'd fight and I would say no I don't want you anywhere near my house but this was said 6 months after his bed and dressers were left without him living with me.

Do you think it's possible he actually has a chance to win this fight?

The reason why I'm posting this is because everyone this day made me out to be an asshole. On this day, I was just minding my own business by sitting on a sofa whilst watching TV. My sister slowly came up behind me and started to tickle me like mad. I'm one of those people who REALLY, REALLY hates being tickled. My sister knew this, but she didn't care. I kept telling her to leave me alone and stop tickling me, but she refused to listen and kept on tickling me. I'm not joking when I say this, but she would not stop tickling me for half an hour. I finally had enough. When she was about to tickle me again, I dug my fingers into both of her arms. The digging wasn't enough to draw blood, but it did stop her from tickling me again. She yelled in pain, and then I pushed her onto the floor and went to my bedroom. Our parents were out grocery shopping at the time. When they both returned, I told them what had happened. However, they sided with my sister in all of this. Both of them were FURIOUS at me. My mum even shouted at me ""YOU HAD ABSOLUTELY NO RIGHT TO DO WHAT YOU DID TO YOUR SISTER!""

She also said to me that I was lucky that she wasn't going to ground me or call the police on me.

Maybe 6 hours on average. I move a lot and do a lot so this is really bad since I probably need closer to 9 hours a day of sleep to feel good and be healthy.

I get that I can conquer my limiting belief by sleeping. I can literally just lay down on my bed, close everything, and do nothing. That's the first step in terms of action towards getting the desired outcome of sleeping more. But...is there like a list of maybe 1 to 3 actionable things that I can do that can maximize my chance of good rest?

For context, I usually wake up at around 7:30-8am, and I've been sleeping at like 2am. During weekends, I get woken up early by sounds at like 8am, and during weekdays, I have work.

I feel like if I can master my sleep, I'll have addressed an issue causing 20-30% of the issues in my life.",NoStupidQuestions

231,1697521731.0,"Is it stupid to expect true love, and leave if I don’t find it?","I’ve been a little bit (translation: extremely and debilitatingly) lonely recently and well, I’ve been fairly confused about how I should act / what I should expect when dating. I’ve always been fairly emotionally sensitive/fragile, and I don’t think it’s healthy for me to date people if I don’t get the quantity of love I feel I need.  I’m very scared of the possibility of love dying out over time, and I really have become almost depressed at the thought that I will never find a person that will reciprocate as much love as I want to give.  

I feel like dating someone whom you have ceased to be in love with is unfair to you and to the person you’re dating, but I’m also scared if I spend my life searching for the perfect person I’ll run out of time and end up alone.  I know fairytale love is rare, but anything less seems almost depressing.  I have a need to love and be loved, not just passively, but I feel I need to be IN love. I fear that that need will forever be unfulfilled, and it’s taking a huge toll on my mental health.  So much so that I’m often finding myself crying at night, and having to distract myself from thinking about it, because the moment I do start thinking of it I just can’t stop.  

So, if I’m in a relationship and the fire goes out, is it reasonable for me to leave, even if we still love eachother?  When I hear people talk about their relationships, it’s almost always depressing.  Of course there’s the occasional one that gives me hope, like [this](https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/s4OnlapYgQ) one,  but is it reasonable to search for that type of love, even if it means giving up relationships that many people would stay in for the rest of their lives? 

I’ve made the mistake of scrolling Reddit for a few years and I’m sure the sheer number of depressing stories on here have affected my judgement of relationships, but normal love just doesn’t seem like it’s enough for me.  I feel like if the love fizzles out, I’d become completely overwhelmed by the fear of missing out on the possibility of “true love” that I would become a bad partner, and I don’t think it’s fair to stay in a relationship if that relationship will never fill your desires, the whole idea of “settling” seems so wrong to me, if you’re “settling” that means that there’s something better out there, and you’ve essentially just given up, and that is not something I would ever want to do. 

And what happens when the love does fizzle out? Especially if you’re married the way people talk about it seems like they just accept it and never go back to being in love again.  I don’t know if I could handle falling out of love with someone I thought would be the one I loved forever.

So, here’s what I want (need) and feel like is unattainable.

-a relationship where the honeymoon phase never ends (or at least where you stay in-love like the post I mentioned [(this one)](https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/s4OnlapYgQ)

-a partner that needs and wants me as much as I need them

-a partner I feel secure with, and who always has my back

-someone I can look at and no matter how bad I’ve been feeling know that my life matters so much more because of them, and that I would give anything for them.

I know people will say I am putting too much emphasis on this part of my life, but I can’t help it, it’s the purest desire I’ve ever felt, it’s unwavering, unquenchable, and all devouring.  Everything I do now, is depressing because I realize I could be doing it with someone I love. It’s like a switch suddenly flipped and I realized I’ve been seeing in black and white my whole life, but the only way to see color is to go through a lifetime of heartbreak and pain, uncertainty and anguish, just for a chance to feel the love I so desperately need to feel.  So, what the fuck do I do?  And to those who have these mythical relationships where your love doesn’t fade, how do you keep that? And to those whose love has fizzled out, what changed from the honeymoon phase that made you and your partner drift apart?

Apologies for the long post, this is sort of half because I want answers, and half because I feel like writing out my feelings helps a bit.  Also, as you probably guessed, I’m fairly young (early 20’s) and sort of trying to understand my fears and feelings.",NoStupidQuestions

This seems absolutely insane and unnecessarily dangerous.

I'm going to give as much context as I can here to try to help explain and see if ANYONE has any advice... 

About 3 or so months ago my boyfriend traded his old unlocked iPhone 13 to someone on Facebook for a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 (for me) and neither of us are new to the trade game but this was an experience that we've never encountered before... He checked the IMEI and serial number while chatting with the person just to double check the phone wasn't stolen and it came back unlocked and not black listed, so far so good! I met up with the lady and we both examined the phones we were going to trade and went ahead with the trade! I get home and put my sim in the phone, GREAT! The phone works great and is really amazing!! I was sooo hype!!

Well fast-forward to about a month later, (this part isn't completely necessarily relevant but some of it is and adds to the craziness) 
I'm in the waiting room with my mom at the surgery center of my local hospital waiting my turn for my outpatient surgery for 4 different issues with my nose and sinuses... I was about to message my best friend so I open my phone and it has a bland lock screen thing pop up displaying the IMEI and Serial number and that rent a center had locked the phone and that I needed to call a 1800 number or come into the local rental a center location to return their property!! The only options on the screen available were to call RAC and an emergency SOS option. I was freaking out and my first thought was IM GOING TO GET CHARGED WITH POSSESSION OF STOLEN PROPERTY 😭 I use my mom's phone to call my boyfriend he says that she never mentioned that the phone came from RAC at all!!!  While I was in surgery he reached out to the lady and she said ""oh I'm sorry the guy I originally got it from stopped making the payments because he lost his job and is in jail now"" and he reminded her that she never once mentioned that it was a RAC phone with payments (or he wouldn't have traded her) and she blocked him.... 

So I'm home recovering from surgery at this point freaking out thinking I'm about to go to jail and that RAC is going to show up any time and so I freaked and decided to turned the phone off after I took my sim card out of it and put it in my back-up phone and just put the Flip4 in the computer drawer and forgot about it.

Fast forward about a month or so later, I turn on the phone and the rent a center lock is still on the screen and I'm just not sure what to do at this point!!! I decided to put my sim card in the phone and I am sitting there debating on calling and explaining the situation to try and avoid any legal action against ME because like I said technically I was in possession of stolen property. The phone starts ringing within an hour of having my SIM card in it, and it's the 1800 number for rent a center. I'm talking to the person and they didn't ask me for any of my personal information other than my first name and my zip code. They connected me to my local RAC and I spoke to the manager and I explained everything!!  The manager reassured me that I wasn't in any kind of legal trouble and that they would just like their phone back and i was so relieved!!!  Well while talking to him he asks if the RAC lock is still on the front screen and I said yes, and he asks for the IMEI number and serial number displayed on the screen. I hear him make a hmmm noise because he was confused and he said ""well this device isn't in my system for some reason"" and he put me on hold... He came back on the call after about 5 minutes and he said that he literally couldn't find that phone in their database and that he would call around to other RAC locations to see if they had any information about the phone. Then he asked me for my first name and my phone number so I gave him that information he said he would call me back by the end of the day before they close....

About 45 minutes after the phone call ended with the RAC manager... The RAC lock screen disappears... I go ahead and call the manager back and I let him know that I'm not sure what I do at this point because the lock disappeared and he said that no one could find any information about the phone and that they were going to keep looking and he would call me back within a few days and that if it's unlocked just to keep using it since it's not in their system and if that lock comes back up to just give them a call.... He never called back...

I've been using the phone again for the last month or so with no new issues so far and I carry a back up phone just in case the RAC lock pops back up....

What could have caused the lock screen thing to disappear??? 
Why couldn't they find the phone in their system??? 
Could it possibly been charged off or something and written up as a loss on their end after so long of non payment and I just got lucky here??? 
Are there any settings on Samsung phones for the future that we can check to make sure to not end up with a phone that still technically belongs to RAC??",NoStupidQuestions

310,1697513696.0,"I have a beautiful piece of naturally-occurring artwork, can I name my price on sites such as Ebay?","I know this is a goofy question, especially since I'm unable to post a picture. I have this artwork which occurred naturally, and I feel as though some type of rich collector might find it appealing enough to pay a lot of money.

I mean, it's uncanny how picture-perfect this artwork is.

It's simply a rough cut panel/board/plank of wood. The woodgrain, for some strange reason, created an unimaginable looking copy of some sort of shark.

I worked at a lumber mill awhile back, I watched thousands of boards of wood pass by me on a conveyor belt every week. I'd see all kinds of woodgrain-images which vaguely resembled faces/objects.

One day, a board of wood came down the line and I just so happen to notice this work of art. I asked a nearby saw operator to roughly cut the image out of the board, kind of like a plaque that you'd hang on a wall. 

I now own this thing, this completely natural image of a shark. The board of wood is about 9 inches long, 1 inch deep, 4 inches wide. 
The woodgrain shark took on a dark green appearance, it even appears to have varying degrees of ""shading."" As if it were painted on by an artist. 
It's unmistakably a shark, a very detailed shark.

I feel like this could be worth hundreds at the very least. But I also don't know how art is valued.

At first, I thought she just needed someone to talk to. But I guess this became an emotional affair because of how she'd compare me to her husband. She invited me over, ""off the books"", and while her husband and kids weren't home for what I now assume was a physical affair. But I'm assuming the husband showed up cause she abruptly cancelled last second.

Since then, she became obsessive. Texting me all the time. Getting upset if I didn't text back (but it's okay if she doesn't), listening to her issues or even coming to talk to her. She even texted me, ""were you here and didn't come say hi to me?"". She's even physically chased after me on more than one occasion.

Now that she doesn't work with me anymore, she finds some excuse to text me or call me every 3 months. It's been her car breaking down, asking stupid questions about the Internet or even something marvel movie related. But she won't answer me after a while and it's annoying.

I know the easy answer is the block her. But I still physically see her because she's still involved in a way at work and we see each other at sports games.

Part of me really wants to just completely call her out. Like when she calls answer saying it's her backup husband speaking or something. But I know the passive route may be easier but she always loses her shit if I go radio silent on her.

383,1697510199.0,Is it wrong to be too open about sensitive things that happened to me?,"So I have a tendency to be too open on sensitive topics and too trusting of people.
I have some common sense so im not going to just yell out ""hey guys look at me im depressed"" or so on, but if I get into a conversation and I feel as if I can comfortably speak on a sensitive topic with this person-- I will. Whether I've known them for a few minutes or a few years. Of course I won't speak on things that I may still have shame from or embarrassing stuff that if it were to ""be used against me"" I wouldn't really care.
But when I was doing this, the other party was fine but my mother got annoyed and angry that I would go to these people about it.
Now I was very confused from her reaction so I went to a friend for a little help and they said ""maybe she just doesn't want you to tell everyone your business,""
which if it had anything to do with her I wouldn't have said anything since it's not my story to speak on...But this was MY story and I was telling it to people who's been vulnerable with me and genuinely gave me good advice.
So I guess, that being said is it wrong to be open? I feel like I don't struggle with social ques and I know there's a time and a place so... Idk Im just a little confused.

in case anyone asks for specific information. 
tw; SA?
but what happened was I was 
Basically groped by a co-worker. It made me feel very gross and uncomfortable. 
I went to my mother (who works with me) and well we didn't really talk about it. She's just the type to not want to dwell on stuff like that while I need to release how I feel to other's or in general.
Well I still struggled with believing it wasn't my fault it happened so I came to these 2 older women coworkers of mine that are very open and accepting. I told them what happened and I was told to report to HR...which unfortunately I will not be doing.
They spoke to me about ways to protect myself etc and overall how to not be a naive 19yo girl 😮‍💨
but my mother took it as me claiming she didn't care because I should have came to her first about it (i did)
and then it just blew up.
I know I'm young and naive so im still learning, my judgment may not always be right ever... But my mother threw it in my face and essentially blamed me for what happened and accused me of acting too grown and giving my trust too easily.

I'm trying to get a state identification card, while being unable to visit a BMV near me (Ohio).

I've had my drivers license for 10 years but I didn't make the deadline to renew before it expired. I'm severely agoraphobic nowadays and I'm unable to leave my house. The covid lockdowns created such anxiety and stress in my life, and being unable to do anything or leave - just left me homebound. Overtime it developed into a major condition.

However, as I'm unable to leave my house, and the closest BMV is 25 minutes away - which is completely outside of my comfort zone; I'm just unable to go there. The issue arises when I can't get any online doctors to assist me because they can't verify my identity. I can't seem to do anything anymore without some sort of identity. I can't start an online business because I can't verify my identity to accept payments, I can't manage crypto because of the same reason. I can't do anything without getting a state ID card.

Is there a way, or an organization that's able to help people in my situation?

I'm at a complete loss of words at how bad things have gotten, and you can't do anything without verifying yourself anymore.

today, need another tb test for a job with vulnerable population in eleder care. of course, it popped positive because you dont shit dead virus out.

new doc seems dismissive of me telling them i took a nasty antibiotic for 6 months, and its known the country administered tb vaccines, which can pop false, but of course the there is no card to prove it. mire CYA as they wont sign a job clearance with out an xray.

they want an x-ray to confirm. im scared that they'll put me on another 6 month, ""Just In Case,"" antibiotic regimen to cover their ass. i dont think the xray showed anything bad before (i dont even remember an xray being requested 10 years ago). the antibiotics has nasty side effects that are advertised at long-term use, and it was done once already without additional exposure to TB risk areas. sure, an immigration doctor covering their bases will make you take it. but... being in the US for 10+ years..no way there's TB. its not like there was any treatment beyond the long term meds.

I'm back in the U.S. now, and I have a job I originally loved, but it's starting to kind of suck. I'd read some less-than-flattering things about the boss on company-review sites, knew it could be true, but took this job anyway. It's good money, I need the health insurance, and it's work I know how to do fairly well, which always brings with it some degree of satisfaction.

But recently, the boss has become ...let's just say....how they were described in company reviews online. I'm seeing how everyone, myself included, is stressed, stretched way beyond their capacity, and working to meet unrealistic goals set by the boss. Plus, we're all having tasks handed to us that are not in line with our actual position because there's no one else to do these tasks.

I told my boss I'm at capacity last week, and they nodded with faux-sympathy and added another massive task to my roster (urgent, of course), a task that another employee, stretched way beyond capacity, has no room to handle.

I'm even being messaged by my boss on weekends, though I don't answer.

I had read online that my company culture is terrible and that the stress of this place will be unmanageable, and I'm a cynic who always assumed companies suck ass by default, but this is wild. Everyone walks (or types, as we're remote) on eggshells around this person. It's completely wild. I feel like I'm in a TV show.

And then a specialist visit could be $300-$500, but if I still haven’t reached my deductible, that means I have to pay that out of pocket, which is kind of like I don’t have insurance at all, no? If my deductible is $7,000, that means I have to see 14 specialists per year at $500 per visit before the insurance company even starts doing what I am paying into it for. That’s absurd!

Is this normal?,"I'm in my early 20s, so I'm supposed to be in my sexual prime. But I can't help but feel like sex is a chore. People my age go on and on about how great sex is, some even do stupid things or put themselves in risky situations just to have sex, but I often just sit there not really understanding what all the hullabaloo is about. I wasn't raised in a religious household, but sex was never talked about, almost taboo. Unlike most people in high school, I graduated high school having never has sex, let alone kissing anyone. So I wonder if that has anything to do with it? Maybe not really being allowed to have sex or explore intimacy as a teenager like most people do killed something in me unconsciously. I remember even after my first time, which was when I was 18 after graduating high school, the guy that I was with I was really attracted to physically and emotionally. We had sex and then I thought to myself, ""Is that it? Is that all there is?"" But I remember when I was in high school I almost had a constant hard-on. Maybe never having those desires fulfilled as a boy turned me off under the surface, but I'm unaware of it 

I've been told to try different toys, different kinds of lube, different positions, to change it up, and I have done all that. It all just feels so repetitive: in and out, in and out until you ejaculate, and the same for your partner until they ejaculate. I'm gay and I once had a guy who didn't douche beforehand and when I penetrated him after awhile I realized there was poop on my penis. That was two years ago, so I'm over it, but I sometimes do think about that. I've had sexual partners comment on how I often seem confused or disinterested or stare into space or look bored when having sex. It's odd because even with someone I find hot it's never really been fulfilling in the end. Even when I was 18 and I was new to sex, I found that I sometimes wouldn't even get erect. I once had a guy freak out that I was so young but couldn't get hard. And now here I am in my early 20s resorting to using Viagra to not embarrass myself and to please my partner.",NoStupidQuestions

Lots of strip malls advertise these cheap and quick massage parlors behind curtained windows with generic names like “Sun Spa” etc. I’ve had two friends who have anecdotally visited spas that included some kind of “happy ending” that they weren’t expecting.

I’m in the market for a cheap massage, but I’m seriously hoping to avoid that kind of “mix-up” altogether. This has literally stopped me from going to get one, as I become doubly convinced that the price is reflecting the additional services and not the quality of the massage itself - and that even if I do bite the bullet and say “no thank you,” it’s probably not gonna be the best massage because that’s just not the spa’s focus.

For context I’ve only gotten massages in sports therapy settings and once or twice at a hotel spa.
I’m at the point where I’m convinced that every cheap walk-in place is gonna mean I have to clarify that it’s not a sexual thing. God forbid I say something before and they’re literally a wholesome family-run spa. But also, god forbid somebody touches my butthole before I can say “no thanks.”

So why have a relationship? They seem to take more away from someone such as myself. Time, effort, some sort of funds, among other things. No matter the angle, sacrifice is made on my end. I can’t think of what I gain that I couldn’t provide myself to begin with. The give and take of a commitment does not seem worthwhile. Yet, for some reason, I still yearn for a type of companionship even though I know it will dilute my capacity as an individual.",NoStupidQuestions

Which is great, right? The only issue is...I fucking hate texting. As much as possible, I just banter for a bit and then like to schedule more dates. I'd rather meet someone in person than talk to a screen.

I've literally been told so many times that I'm a dry texter which I've done purposefully so that they can expect that moving forward and we just meet up instead but I'm honestly reaching my breaking point.

I don't want to spend an hour or two hours of my day just bantering to a screen. It literally doesn't do much for me. In fact, I feel like a loser when I'm doing it. Tapping on a screen while smiling like an idiot when we could just be flirting face-to-face again.

I usually find Koreans to be the most attractive for me (although other nationalities too are attractive nonetheless), so is it just weird of me or is this really common on some people because I know many people are attracted to those only of same nationalities more than being with foreigners.

I'd come down and my mum would ask me something like ""Have you just woke up?"" I've had this conversation enough times to know it's not a real question. She already had the answer in her head and is just waiting for me to give that answer so we can have an argument over it. So instead of answering her, I call her out on it. Tell her she already knows what the answer is and every time we have this conversation it devolves into an argument, so why even ask the question. It replaces the initial anger she felt with embarrassment because she went in with an expectation of how the conversation was going to turn out and I flipped it into calling her out on her behaviour.

So the technique is recognising patterns in somebodies behaviour and using that to deduce what their motivation is and then instead of having the conversation go the way they planned you've used that information to flip the topic back onto them and now you're talking about their behaviour instead of your own. But what is the name of this? Like ""You think you're sly, but you're not. I know what you're doing, let's talk about it.""",NoStupidQuestions

There's this one bulldog I see frequently who always stops are states, but I never felt threatened. Other dogs react differently; there's a small dog that yaps at me, a slightly larger small dog that seems to like me and always comes up for a bit of fuss wagging his tail. Large dogs generally don't seem to care.

Today I was rolling (rollin rollin) down the street and I saw a man with his dog, This dog was probably medium size but obviously very muscular. It looked like this, but not smiling:

As we passed, me at the edge of the road and dog on the pavement, the dog changed demeanour, stood between me and their owner and stared at me. If was clearly a defensive position. The owner called for him to stop, but the dog didn't change. Also the dog wasn't on a leash.

I've felt uncomfortable about this situation since it happened a few hours ago, because dog attacks happen and if that happened I probably would have been mauled and possibly died. I considered asking the man to put his dog on a leash, but that would've just escalated things.

I’m interested in politics/diplomacy/etc., My problem- my degree has no relevance whatsoever; it is philosophy and theology. I cannot change to philosophy and politics.    But my point is- imagine two ultra-qualified candidates:

Undergrad in philosophy and theology from Durham
Masters in political theory from Oxford
Graduate diploma in economics- Cambridge
Masters in economics- LSE
PHD in economics- Oxford

2
Undergrad in philosophy and politics from Durham

  Hi there, I started working for Merry Maids about a month ago. I have 4+ years of professional residential and commercial cleaning, let’s just say I’ve cleaned some nasty places before. Which is no big deal because I love cleaning, it’s a de-stresser for me. I will start off with , Merry maids does most of their appointments online, they never go to the location to see actually how dirty a place is to give a quote. They just do it by square footage. So we are given a house that is usually cleaned once a month but we were not cleaning the main house this time we were cleaning the mother-in law house behind it. We get there and it’s on a lake, it’s a lake house. Nobody lives there but they come for vacation. Anyways we get to the mother in law house and it looks like a dog had diarrhea all over the floor, there is broken glass , No running water and huge rat droppings so me and my team mate quickly exit. We call the office they say to take pictures and that the customer will be there in 10 mins to let us in and that we can clean the main house. He shows us around for a min or too, most of the lights are still off , and it’s looks pretty clean like it would just be a simple dusting and doing floors . So he leaves and we get our stuff to go upstairs and we can see the top of the mantle is covered in rat feces. I’m appalled and mad at this point. I’m not an exterminator I’m a house keeper. I call the office and we start to notice the droppings are everywhere, on the furniture and the tables, all over the floor but it was dark and so small you could barley see. So I call the office and tell them I am not cleaning this house and pack my stuff and go back to the office. The manager is overly angry when I get back, his whole face is turning red before he even talked to me. And I told him “ you are going to talk to me with respect” and that made him even madder he was like “in my office” he goes on to say that I have an attitude and if they give me a task I need to do it no matter what. That it wasn’t a democracy it was a dictatorship and he is in charge. Also that his customers come before the employees. He then says “ if you cant handle rats, bugs, snakes and other creatures maybe housekeeping isn’t the right industry for you, if you see rat droppings you just get your portable vacuum ( the vacuum we take into every customers home) and vacuum it up”. I was disgusted by what he said and I told him I didn’t have a problem cleaning the droppings the proper way, I just wanted the proper protective gear to clean it with and for there also to be no live rats in the home running around. I don’t want to get bit and get rabies. He acted like I was being a drama Queen and told me I was fired. He then decided to give me another chance and said “so if I send you to that house tmrw are you going to clean it?” And I said “if I say no are you gonna fire me? I don’t feel constable with no protective gear” and he was like that’s it this is just not going to work and fired me. I started sobbing and left. Am I in the wrong for refusing? I read on cdc website to never vacuum droppings as you can get many different diseases from inhaling the particles from the rat droppings.

Obviously some games just want to have sexy characters, that’s fine. Usually when that happens it’s with both genders. What doesn’t make sense to me is shit like Atomic Heart. Why the hell did they make a normal shooter have basically animated sex dolls as an enemy. Like was that REALLY needed? Honestly even with the “strong” female characters that people point to looking “normal” like Ada Wong, Aloy, and modern Lara Croft still have skimpy sexy outfits. Why is Ada Wong wearing a skintight dress when she’s fighting! This also applies to people who have basically naked anime waifu stickers plastered all over their gaming setups.   When I ask this question, people respond with the classic answer of “well guys like it and they want to look at characters that they find sexy” but that doesn’t make sense to me. Why would you want to be horny when you are playing a video game. That would distract me! Do some guys NEED to be looking at scantily clad hyper sexy woman 100% of the time or they won’t be interested?  I’m not saying all women characters should never be sexy or allowed to wear hot outfits, but sometimes it just baffles me. Like the people who make nude mods for games or those “Skyrim women mod 4K super sexy face remodel” people.  Like if you do that do you actually play with the mod on? Does it change your experience that much? I just don’t get why people need to be surrounded by half naked woman constantly. I see much much less women engaging in this behavior for men. Like maybe some women will have like a shirtless poster of their favorite actor, or change the skin in a video game to something that they find hot, but no where NEAR to the level of what I see with men.

My employees at work seem jealous that a younger person is in charge and try to belittle me all the time. Never mind the fact that I worked my ass off in college to get into this position so I could get as far away from my Nparents as possible. I took risks and it worked out, most of my employees are aware of this from times we’ve had small talk.

 This isn’t just a work issue. I noticed people generally value age a lot, and when you’re in a position that’s considered more respectable than them, they always come up with reasons in their head why you got there. Bc of my Nparents I learned not to respect someone bc of age, but by the kind of person that they were. 

Then I look at Reddit where apparently people here think adults who are 26 are babies who can’t even cook their own food. And frankly, it’s insulting, and I truly feel like no one outside of my gf and a couple friends of mine who came out of similar situations understands this. 

I understand I’ll be more mature when I’m older, but I can tell you with objectivity that I am more mature than many people who ARE older than me.

873,1697476560.0,Help!!,"  For context, my bf(24) and I (19) have been together for almost two years. At the beginning of our relationship we navigated through a lot of issues, he broke several of my boundaries I consider unfaithful/cheating n refused to ever get help for it again nonetheless ever really even talk abt any of it from that point on. He is known for lying his way out of situations with me is all I can really say. A few months ago, this idea of cuckholding got brought up into conversation. In the past before our 1yr mark, he had told me he wanted me to explore my bisexuality more and he didn’t care/wanted me to have relations with these other women. He didn’t want to be involved but at the time would still occasionally bring stuff up that i now realize sounds like he wanted to watch if I was ok with it, I wasn’t, he knew that. Whole reason I even told him I’d ever even be ok with the “poly” stuff is if I had a very strong spiritual or emotional connection wit the woman because I had no desire to go and do this to him it felt wrongful, and I haven’t even found anyone in that sense that’s made me comfortable still….besides him. Flash forward to now, and a few months back again. He kept bringing up the idea of me being wit someone else n getting fucked…seemed jus like a weird jealousy fantasy but I didn’t understand because my jealousy jus hurts me yk…I told him multiple times I wasn’t down with it. 
A.) We hadn’t been getting along all the time I wasn’t gonna do something like that when our relationship wasn’t the best anyways
B.) Id be fairly uninterested and unimpressed by men as I usually am if I was single, and I really get grossed out thinking abt it in a sex doll manner way. Some random guy tryna fuck be for both of their pleasure but not mine. Disgusting. 
C.) I was never interested in the thought of it in general im kind of a shy person when it gets to knowing me sexually and he lied about me to these people tellin em id do all this stuff to them, be ok with it, etc. he went as far as lying to me about two months ago when I saw other convos stating “I’ll help clean the both of you up afterwards in the shower” the guy was being really gay with him and I wasn’t ok with it in general…he told me he didn’t mean it like that and that he would jus help me and clean the room up but in those texts ^^^ he literally said the same exact thing to some new guy.       
I’m  so disturbed thinking about it all and him lying about it. 
D.) I told him to NEVER send these people pictures of myself. He has been. And deleting them. He told the first man you’ll see in this video named ‘Mack’ who kept asking to see my pu$$. I’m so scared he sent my pictures I’ve given him to these. He asked me for a pic of myself when we were doing sexual shit a few days before that guy asked him too. 

Whenever I found this app on his phone where all these messages were occurring, he forcibly took his phone back from me and tried immediately leaving with it. He ran all the way across town sprinted from me through streets with me trying to talk to him jus to try and get away from me to delete the evidence, well since he didn’t have wifi he ran all that way for nothing. I chased him in my bare feet just to see wtf he was doing I was so shocked he was acting like a child.

Last thing, the fact that he knows I wouldn’t be ok with it and is lying to all these people about me (I’ve been with him for weeks, haven’t seen my friends, haven’t been drunk or fucked by other dudes, etc. what he’s all claiming) is insane. He told them all he would have to wait for me to know, to already be in the room with the both of them at a hotel or somewhere far away this weekend or during Halloween as a surprise???! Doesn’t really seem like a surprise seems like he’s trying to force me in a scenario where I’d have little room to stand up to the idea of “no” possibly being trapped with a crazier man than him. I feel so distraught by all of this like it was half ass turned into some weird rapey seeming fantasy…would like to know what anyone else would do in this scenario?? Also on top of this he’s been visiting ice spices facebook page and this page for all these sports women to show off their asses n muscles n shit without me knowing. Im so ashamed dude

The state of Gaza/Israel right now is horrendous, the poverty situation in the UK is awful, there is animal cruelty on a mass scale all over the world, and to top it all off we are just destroying the planet. 

I have a partner, a cat, family and friends that I do love and I say I am not depressed or suicidal but I'm just over life. Does anyone else feel this way? 

I don't really find joy in much anymore because it's just all overshadowed with the issues of the world. I tried starting my own little charity to try and help with some of the financial struggles people are facing but despite helping some, it pains me there are so many people I can't help.

892,1697475815.0,"What are normal, healthy views on sex and how have these evolved over time?","I realize opinions will be diverse but in my culture it is taboo to talk about sex, so everything I know is from porn and the internet. I know my cultural beliefs are extreme but I also suspect the girls I've been talking to represent another extreme and I don't really understand what the middle ground looks like. - in short I can't differentiate porn from reality and I'm too embarrassed to talk about this in person.

I don't understand the appeal of casual sex. FWB is kind gross to me, but I've seen more and more girls online proudly calling themselves FWB, or whores or sluts and the like. I always thought they were just promoting their onlyfans (which I also don't get but atleast I can see money as a motivator) I view these words in a negative connotation. I don't get why there are so many slutty girls out there. I've encountered more and more who do it for free. Or is there not really and I'm just biased? 

I think lots of men are into casual sex and I also think that's gross but I understand their motivation. It's the girls that I don't get. Porn to me seems misogynist and dominated by men. What is the appeal? Why do they want to be objectified? Obviously girls like sex too but don't they want to be equal partners? Why focus on men? 

So this is where I'm at. I realize most people aren't traditional wait for marriage and I suspect that the OF girls are also an extreme. How do I get out of my puritanical mindset. What do normal, healthy sexual relationships look like? I'm hoping for respectful, philosophical and intellectual conversation on this topic",NoStupidQuestions

They usually made me cry because they were so painful and it felt like knife was stabbing my brain. They didn't happen during the day.

 I had one at night once, and I had a soft yellowy nightlight then. Looking at it seemed to help, so I got on the floor in front of it and stared at it. The pain started to ease, and after about ten minutes, I was able to go to sleep.

At twelve, I had one, and I went into the bathroom and stared at the glaring light over the sink. Instant relief. After that, I never had another migraine again, and I'm 33.

 My parents didn't believe I had migraines, because according to them, kids can't get them. That's bull. Also, I'm autistic, and autistic kids are twice as likely to get migraines. Nobody ever believed me when I said light helped because it seems to make everyone else worse.

 Recently, I found one other person in a migraine post on fb yesterday who says sunlight helps! I'm not alone, lol! She said she never met anyone else like me either.
 
Another commenter said it must be something about my pupils retracting (Soft light= slow relief, bright light=fast relief), and she said she would try it.

Also, he teaches my Electrocardiology class, so this stuff isn't relevant to his class at all, he just likes talking about it.

For example, Last Monday he felt like we were all still tired from fall break (we were). So instead of lecture he spent the entire 50 minutes of class talking about life goals and what we do after we achieve those goals. He told us about the book Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl and I literally almost broke down crying in class (last week was really hard lol). Since then I've just wanted to talk to him. Not about anything really specific, I just want to talk to him. I feel like he has a lot of knowledge and I want to learn about life from him. But he seems so unapproachable. Like why would he want to talk with me? What should I ask him about? How do I ask about life advice if I don't know what I want to know?

Background: I am taking a trip to Vegas in a few weeks and it's my tradition to get a limo from the airport.  When the driver picks us up from the airport they put the group name on the sign and I always like the name to be extremely funny, but I am struggling this time to think of the right name.  The group is myself (26m) and a husband and wife 10 years older than I am.  I know their is some great comedy to be had, I just can't think of anything great.

967,1697470355.0,Is housing a human right?,"some may argue that this is equivalent to saying a human is entitled to the resources to build and maintain all this housing and that no one is entitled to the labor and materials of others. 

...and that the housing is a commodity to be earned and traded on an open market.

Perhaps housing are not fundamental, essential human rights and only needs at the secondary or tertiary levels.

Care.com only allows me to search a 50-mile radius per zip-code. I want to search potential clients across the US meeting specific criteria (hours, pay, etc.).

There's a humorous strawman used around the internet which is where first poster says, ""drink more water!"" and then every poster after is like ""um actually i cant, you shouldnt be so assumptive with blanket statements etc""

Are there any conditions which actually make it so someone can't drink the recommended amount of water each day?

976,1697469572.0,"People say staring is rude, but when you're talking to someone it's apparently rude to not make eye contact. So are you supposed to stare when someone is talking to you?","Or are you supposed to look for a few secs then look away? I know, this is a silly question. I'm a young adult and all my life when someone is talking to me I would always either look at the person for a few secs, look away, and repeat; or I would not look at the person when speaking because I've always been told it's rude to stare. I do listen to what people say, but try to not look for too long as I don't want to make the person uncomfortable. I recently had someone, an older man, comment about how it's strange and makes it seem like I'm lying when I'm talking when I don't look at him when talking to him. At that moment I thought to myself, well aren't you not supposed to stare at people? I didn't say anything to him besides ""sorry"" then abruptly ended the conversation. I've never had someone comment on that, but it got me thinking. 

I've always been taught it's rude to stare. When talking to someone, is that the only socially acceptable time to stare at someone to make it seem like you have their full attention? Every society has a different culture, so I'm in the US, if that matters.",NoStupidQuestions

Example:

* Sleep 2am to 11am (9 hours): Well rested.

* Sleep 8pm to 5am (9 hours): Tired as hell.

It’s such a strong difference that compensating by sleeping more (but still waking up early-ish) doesn’t help:

* Sleep 3am to 10am (7 hours): Still rested enough.

* Sleep 8pm to 7am (11 hours): Still tired.

8,1697560908.0,ELI5: explain the effects of aggregate demand (econ),"An increase in aggregate consumption demand occurs from government monetary policy. Will:    

Businesses increase their prices.  

OR  

Businesses increase quantity supplied.    

&#x200B;

I believe (correct me) that Keynes's assumption was that businesses would undergo capital/labor investment and a degree of 'risk' (however distorted that may be) to increase the quantity that they supply. It seems to me, that upon an increase in AD, that there might be a stronger incentive to simply increase prices to get the best returns out of that new demand.  

Example:  Assume that I have a donut shop and i am faced with, overnight, a doubling from 100 people to 200 people wanting to buy a donut at my pre-AD-increase prices. I can either incur cost and risk to make twice as many donuts (assuming I make exactly the amount of donuts I sell), or just ask my local micro-economist to tell me what the highest price I could charge for my current quantity maximum of 100 donuts is. Which plan of action would you recommend to the donut owner?    

The situation above, of course, focuses on an isolation of increased AD - it does not include any mention of competition. My intuition is that, if the donut market is perfectly competitive, then the labor investment and innovation in that market stays the same before AD and after AD. Upon the initial increase, prices will increase. If there is a viable investment that would increase quantity supplied and lower prices to compete better and incurr demand from more people - and increase overall efficiency in that economy - than would it be made regardless of changes in aggregate demand?

Im sure the answer to this is simple and that i'm just kind of slow, this is just where my train of thought has led me I guess.",explainlikeimfive

100,1697401123.0,ELI5: How do file hosts control(?) the speed at which your file gets downloaded?,"Just curious how do file hosts (e.g. Rapidgator) control the speed at which you are able to download a file?

For example, if you choose a free option, you download the file at X hours. However when you're a Premium user, the file is downloaded 10x faster.

Like it's the same file with the same file size, right? What do they do so that there will be difference at which a user will be able to download a file depending on their subscription? If it's feasible, would also like a visualization of what happens when your browser downloads via free vs. via premium account.

Thank you!

Unfortunately every article either dives into deep details or completely skims over operating principles.  It seems like the idea is that solar heat evaporates some water vapor. Then the water vapor condenses and is collected, and releases heat. That much makes sense. But these 'multistage' stills seem to be based on the idea of collecting the heat of condensation evaporate more water? 

What I don't understand is--for the water vapor to condense, it has to be touching a surface below the boiling point. Ergo, if the water is hot enough to evaporate, the water vapor can't condense and add more heat to it. If it's cool enough for the water vapor to condense on it and warm it up, it's because the temp is low enough that evaporation isn't occurring...

818,1695994654.0,eli5 What is Frame Dragging in physics,"There are a only couple very old answers on this sub that seemed to skip a few key points so I hope it’s ok to ask for a better explanation?

I’m a fan of physics and have read books on SR so I think my understanding is just a couple steps shy of it clicking in (I hope). I know it has to do with how gravity travels at the speed of light and as, say, a planet moves through space it will generate gravitational waves moving away from it (similar to a boats wake maybe? The waves in each direction are not moving at equal speed relative to the object maybe?). I think Frame Dragging comes in when the object is spinning, fast? 

Perhaps where I start to lose it is when length contraction is explained (which is ironic as I own an electrical construction company). The wiki says a wheel moving forward at (near) the speed of light (or rolling forward moving at C?? It doesn’t specify which?) has the top going near C, but the *speed at the bottom is always zero*. WTF? How can a wheel rotate with the bottom not rotating?

There was also a reference to how a gyroscope spins being similar to the same effect which is why the object has to spin fast for the effect to be relevant. I barely understand gyroscopes in the sense that it’s a conservation of angular momentum. Always running forward and pushing the other direction giving it its force to wanting to stay in position but anything beyond that is above my pay grade. 

I learn best visually if that helps. I’ve tried to wrap my head around some things then when someone pops a gif of the idea/object in motion my brain goes, “Well why didn’t you just say that? Of COURSE it works that way!” (And then I feel dumb for not being able to visualize it. Once it clicks though I’m down to clown)

Why not just use joules for total amount of energy used and watts for consistent/average output over a specific time? I assume watt-hours is how many watts are consistently produced over an hour period but it is used often in unhelpful scenarios. When talking about say solar generation, someone could say ""my solar array produces 12kWh every day"". So 12kWh for 24 hours means your solar array produces 0.5kW of power for the entire day. How was watt-hours helpful in anyway to describe the solar array's power output? 

Or when talking about a cities power output, the reports are measured in Gigawatt-hours over the entire year. Why is quantifying a cities yearly output over an hour long period helpful?

Now if we compare the 2 given examples, it becomes even more confusing. If I had a solar array that produces 12kWh every day, how many solar arrays would I need to power a city the needs 5000 GWh every year? 5000 GWh every year is around 570.78 MW, so if I just used the standard watts over watt-hours I would have a simple convertion between scenarios while still having the option to say ""0.5kWs each day"" or ""570.78MWs for a year"".

Like in my mind, increasing the reserve ratio is the obvious answer because 0% is obviously not smart.

Why don't objects slow down naturally?,"I understand why it needs to exist, otherwise the Earth wouldn't keep spinning, coins would fall over immediately when you tried spinning them, artificial gravity wouldn't be possible, etc. But I'm not sure how it works out physically. (nb. I'm talking without regard to drag, friction, etc. For example out in space where those are negligible factors.)

By definition, a spinning object is under acceleration (individual points on the object are constantly turning around the center of rotation, which is a form of acceleration in linear physics). And force requires energy, so why doesn't the spinning of an object expend its angular momentum and slow it down over time?

Along the same vein, how does artificial gravity work in this context? As I understand it, centrifugal force is a fictitious force, but if I am inside a spinning object I am still being pressed against it as it turns and subjected to acceleration (from an observer's point of view, at least). And so since I am being accelerated, something has to be using energy to accelerate me, right?

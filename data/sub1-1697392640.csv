He says shaking the pictures is completely unnecessary, that Kodak never told consumers to shake the pictures, and that no Kodak publication, user's manual, or website has ever instructed consumers to shake the camera. They have no idea why people do it or how it started.

Then the exec says the company sent reps to other countries to see if they have different Polaroid developing rituals and gives examples of what they found:

In (some country, I forgot which one) people sit on the picture for several hours.

In (some other country) people put the photo on the top shelf of a bookshelf and wait for it to develop overnight

In (yet another country) people attach the picture to the foot of a migratory bird. They believe if the bird returns with the developed picture 6-8 months later, then it was a good picture.",NoStupidQuestions

I'm not going to judge it anything here, I just genuinely want to learn and broaden my world view. 

I see numerous posts on reddit talking about how expensive medical care is and how they are now in debt for thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. This is normally followed up by discussion of how bad America's medical system is, and act like these bills are the norm for anyone with health issues. 

But my question is, why ain't these people have health insurance? I was under the impression that full time employers must provide health insurance or pay a fairly hefty fee every year. For those who can't work full time, Medicare is usually available as well.

111,1697385051.0,Was is flirting etiquette?,"My whole life I‚Äôve been taught by women, teachers, and online culture that I need to‚Ä¶ I guess be careful when I talk to women? Sparingly talk to women? Idk it was never really clear.

I was kind of told it‚Äôs not ok to flirt with women because it‚Äôs sexual harassment or I‚Äôm making people uncomfortable. I‚Äôve been also told the worst places to do it are at school, work, bars, and if I see a woman enjoying being out on her own anywhere, I also shouldn‚Äôt really bother her by flirting.

So I don‚Äôt really know what to do. I kind of just wait for them to say or start something because I don‚Äôt want to be a bad person or seen as creepy or overbearing. 

I also don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs appropriate to touch them. Again I‚Äôve always waited for them to do that. 

I‚Äôve had long terms relationships. Upwards of 5 years. And at the start of each I would make sure not to even sit on the same couch as them because Im afraid they‚Äôd feel uncomfortable like I‚Äôve always been told.

And as a single person idk if I‚Äôm flirting with someone or their just being friendly. Idk if I‚Äôm aloud to gently touch them here and there to show some slight physical intimacy. Like something as small as holding their back gently while walking through crowds. Or giving them a cute shove when they say something goofy or funny. Or holding their hand to compliment their nails or bracelet. 

And kissing is out of the question. I won‚Äôt do it until they straight up ask me. 

The risk of being a bad person is way greater then the reward of someone by chance being into me. 

So what‚Äôs the etiquette? How are you supposed to flirt? When is it ok to talk to women? When is it overdoing it? What should my expectations be? Should I just be friendly and wait for them to initiate something? Is it sexual harassment and I should just take the risk? What‚Äôs the line between friendly and intimate?

I'm thinking about all those worst case scenarios where being single forever or ""What if I'll never find anybody else?"", ""What if I'm unlucky or there's a spell over me that's gonna make it impossible for me to find another one?"", ""What if this?"", ""What if that?""...  
  
Having a girlfriend means a lot to me. I guess this is why I'm having these thoughts. I try to think like a normal person but it doesn't work:  
  
\- ""Of course I'll find somebody else. Everybody does.""  
\- ""I just need to get socialize, meet with people.""  
\- ""Nobody knows the future. It's very uncertain. I have to focus on now.""  
  
NO. Sadly these kind of ways of thinking don't help me at all. I have intolerance towards uncertainty and it's making me suffer a lot and I can't get that idea of being single forever out of my mind.   
  
English is my second language. I tried to do my best while writing. If there are some mistakes I'm sorry in advance.

**In short, my problem is that I'm afraid of the possibility of not getting another girlfriend. Is this possible?**  

Thank you.

179,1697379542.0,Does Fingerprinting Everybody All The Time Really Keep Anyone Safe?,"My brother's youngest just graduated from high school.  For like 15 years he's been a ""parent helper"" at the school, going in to paint sets for the high school plays and do all kinds of other stuff, band booster, basketball Dad, lots of things.  Every teacher in the place knows him (it's a small school and all four of his kids went there).

He no longer has any kids at the school, but some of the kids there are friends of his daughter who just graduated, and he's still friends with the other parents. The fall play is coming up, and so one of the other Drama Club Parents asked if he would be back to help out.  He said sure, and then the school board came up with like a dozen forms he has to fill out.  Proof of covid vaccination and some others, well, fine, but they never asked before.  And they want him to get fingerprinted and have a background check.

He thinks that's idiotic; he's been at the school longer than several of the school board members have been office.  And then we got to wondering: does taking all these fingerprints really have any positive effect on student safety, or is this just a way to funnel a bunch of money to companies that do background checks?

One point for him is that he has never been fingerprinted.  His prints aren't in any database anywhere.  If he does this, now they will be, and that's bothering him.  I told him it's no big deal; I had a job with a security clearance once and I'd been fingerprinted and had a background check.  He replied by mentioning cases where people were wrongly accused or convicted of crimes because a fingerprint at a crime scene was incorrectly matched with their fingerprint, which can only happen if your fingerprint is in a database somewhere.  Sure, it's rare (but maybe not as rare as we hope it is), but it does happen.

Then I got to thinking about how after 9/11 the government went bonkers with spying on everybody, spending billions of dollars to no good purpose, and never actually catching a single actual terrorist.  Is this another case like that?  Is there any actual evidence that fingerprinting everybody all the time genuinely works to prevent crimes?

209,1697377410.0,Why do people act like high interest rates on cars are such a big deal?,"First off, I'm gonna start off with the fact that interest on everything right now is ridiculous. It's entirely too high in general, and on something like a house, it could literally change your mortgage cost by more than $1000/month by paying a 7% interest rate vs 5%. So that's definitely notable.

But my question here is about cars specifically. Interest has a way smaller impact on a short-term purchase worth tens of thousands of dollars.

Just for fun, I configured a 2024 Honda CR-V and compared the monthly finance cost at different interest rates. With my configuration, the car came out to $36,175 on their website (I'm sure this would be higher at the actual point of sale because if dealer fees, etc., but that's beside the point). Right now, Honda has a promo where a 5 year loan is at 4.9% interest, which is decent. 

The monthly cost for a 5 year loan on a $36,175 car with 10% down (which are all pretty standard terms) is [$671/month at 4.9%](https://i.imgur.com/v5j2V7a.jpg). With 0 changes except bumping the interest rate to 7%, the monthly cost goes up to [$706/month](https://i.imgur.com/5Y7igM6.jpg).

At the monthly scale, that's a $35 difference. That increase is negligible in the grand scheme of things. Even by the end of the loan, you will have paid a grand total of $40,260 on the 4.9% rate vs $42,360 at 7%. Yeah that's an extra $2100, but again that's over the course of 5 years, so it's only $420/year.

I'm not saying this to get people to try to buy cars. Shit's expensive rn. Yall do what you want with your money. All I'm wondering is why an interest rate a few percent higher takes a car from ""affordable"" territory to ""not worth it"" for so many people when the total monthly cost difference is <$50 in a lot of cases",NoStupidQuestions

There's no doubt that for an individual incident, the decision of police not to engage in a high speed pursuit lessens the danger to the public. But does it also encourage criminals to engage in riskier behavior, knowing that they have a lower chance of being caught? 

Say that enacting such policies have caused a 50% reduction in public risk on a per-incident basis; if criminals feel empowered to do more illegal things as a result, and deaths/injuries in aggregate are 2x higher...maybe we're actually better off going back to the old model.

I know you could argue this same thing for other things like some cities' decisions to stop prosecuting certain low-level crimes. But those situations are much more dependent on context, in my opinion...no-pursuit policies seem to have been adopted by nearly all large and medium police departments around the country, for at least the better part of a decade.",NoStupidQuestions

I‚Äôm also quite afraid of putting them in, I don‚Äôt want to scratch my eyes or anything like that. I also heard they can fall, does that happen often?

I play video games for 5 hours a day every single day and do not wish to stop or do anything that could minimize that time. If I get contacts I assume it should be better, right? My eyes would be more rested and it won‚Äôt negatively impact the time I can spend in front of a screen, either pc or phone, right?..

299,1697365954.0,"Is there scientific evidence supporting the hypothesis that the human brain operates in two distinct modes, one of production and another of consumption?","I have been pondering the idea that the brain operates on two distinct levels or modes, and I am unsure whether this concept holds scientific validity. My hypothesis revolves around the notion that our cognitive processes can be primarily categorized into two modes: production and consumption. I believe that these modes are fundamentally different, each pertaining to specific types of tasks.  
  
In the mode of production, individuals are actively engaged in activities such as cleaning dishes, playing games, musical instrument performances, or even walking. During this phase, we are essentially executing actions, relying on our existing knowledge or immediate environmental feedback to guide our actions. This mode appears to be the opposite of consuming information, as our primary focus is on output.  
  
Conversely, the mode of consumption pertains to activities involving the intake of information, which could include reading books, watching television series, listening to a speaker, or simply absorbing information from our surroundings. This mode revolves around information reception rather than active output.  
  
Remarkably, there exists a unique medium in which both these modes coexist harmoniously, and that is the act of having a conversation. Engaging in a conversation entails both the production of thoughts, words, and responses as well as the consumption of information through active listening and interpretation. The simultaneous utilization of both production and consumption modes in conversation results in a distinct and pleasurable experience.  
  
One fascinating observation I've made is that when I engage in the mode of production for several days in a row, I often experience exhaustion, and my mind naturally gravitates towards seeking a balance by shifting into the mode of consumption. Conversely, after extended periods of consuming information, I find myself inclined to engage in productive activities. This cyclical interplay between production and consumption is of particular interest to me.  
  
My question is whether there is any scientific basis or research in the fields of neurobiology and cognitive psychology that supports or contradicts this hypothesis. Can the brain truly be categorized into these two modes of production and consumption, and are there any known mechanisms or processes underlying this differentiation?

We ended up getting back together, and we‚Äôve been dating again for a year (4 years total minus 3 weeks last year). Thing is, even still that I know it‚Äôs in the past and it‚Äôs all fixed, just hearing the first note of the song, or the title mentioned in casual conversation, I immediately feel the rush of all that despair and pain come back to me. 

This song can almost instantly cause a panic attack for me, and I hear it more often than I would like even when it‚Äôs just out and about on the radio or playing in stores. I had to be put on PTSD and anxiety medication just to deal with daily life from how hard this song broke me.

I want to get over this. I‚Äôve tried exposure therapy, purposeful avoidance, mental preparation, everything my therapists and psychiatrists recommended me. It doesn‚Äôt do anything, and anytime it gets stuck in my head I feel so uneasy and physically sick to my stomach from the painful memories it brings back. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. SO doesn‚Äôt connect music to memories like I do so they don‚Äôt fully understand or always remember that it is triggering to me to hear it (it‚Äôs still on their playlist, but to be fair it is a really good song musically). 

This has been going on for over a year and I heard it today again and can‚Äôt stop thinking about it (how it plays on a loop in my head whenever I hear it) - is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice would be appreciated.",NoStupidQuestions

But like I‚Äôm freaking out cuz this isn‚Äôt my bed, it‚Äôs my sisters air mattress with a sheet on it and I don‚Äôt want her in the morning when we take it down thinking I pissed on her sheets. There‚Äôs a damp spot from my shoulders to my butt and it‚Äôs not wide and it doesn‚Äôt smell like piss but you‚Äôd think with that big of a wet spot I‚Äôd be covered in sweat as well but I‚Äôm dry. But the damp part doesn‚Äôt look darker on the sheet but when you feel it it‚Äôs definitely damp, not like soaked just damp, so I truly don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs piss.

318,1697364342.0,When is a good time to start dating?,"I'm 25M and this has been a huge gap in my life. I've always been deathly afraid and anxious at the thought of dating. In the seven years of my adult life I've been through ups and downs but it's mostly been downs. Recently though, I feel like things are actually getting better. I'm finally building resilience to setbacks and I'm actually feeling determined to get out of unhealthy patterns. I understand myself and my emotions better than ever.

I decided I'd try giving dating apps a shot a few months ago. Took me a while to build confidence to use them, but I'm getting matches now and it's providing me the promise of change in my life. But I'm extremely inexperienced in everything related to dating, all the way down to just making friends with someone. I even tend to hold back and withdraw when getting close to people, and probably the most important pattern I'm trying to break. My inexperience makes me feel like I'm not ready, meanwhile people my age are often starting to move on from experimenting and building up experience. 

I feel like I waited too long and should use the energy I have now towards making the best of the dwindling opportunities I have left. I know the right person won't care about inexperience, as long as we can hit it off. Me withdrawing doesn't make this easy though. So while I feel some rush, I also feel with every match I withdraw from or don't give my all, that I'm really just not ready for this yet. Still too much hurt and internal trouble. Need to learn how to make friends first, set appropriate boundaries, learn how to grow into my own identity after years of denying this to myself, hell, get a double bed and a decently-sized desk in a room away from my parents. I feel like people will expect at least some of these things from me and I feel so far behind the curve on them I can't reasonably let them get to know me without disclosing these.

I'm torn between just throwing myself in the deep, and waiting for a bit to get myself a little more together. How do you judge what's the right time, especially as I'm only getting older? Like, I'm probably not ready for dating and will probably mess up a lot and I don't wanna put a burden on the people who have to deal with that, waste their time and all.

It was quite a messy on and off sort of breakup I'm sad to say. Since then I've worked on myself so much, and I'm a much better person. In a way I've been grateful for the breakup.

Long story short, I thought I was doing good but life has absolutely kicked my ass the past couple of months. I'm really struggling mentally. Last night I was betrayed by one of my best friends so now I literally don't have any friends anymore. It's a problem so intertwined with that group that there's no real way to resolve things other than cutting them off. That also means my long term plans are sort of fucked because I was due to move in with him while I'm studying. I'm in a really bad place. What I really need is to chat to someone I can trust. I realise now there's no one in this world I trust more than my ex. It's really become clear to me how much of a diamond of a person she really is.

323,1697363915.0,Is permanent hair dye supposed to hurt?,"I‚Äôve been dyeing my hair blue regularly for the past 6-7 years and wanted to switch to permanent instead to reduce how often I bleach my hair. So far so good, but the last time I used permanent dye‚Äî a couple months ago‚Äî it stung so bad that I was like rushing to get it out as fast as possible. For the record, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm sensitive to pain. I‚Äôve gotten tattoos, piercings by hand and a couple surgeries so I‚Äôm no stranger to long periods of discomfort lol.

Yesterday, I got some more permanent dye and as I started my game plan, I decided to skip lightening. My hair is faded into a minty green at this point, but it‚Äôs still pretty light. Especially since my hair is usually medium to light brown. My roots still aren‚Äôt really visible either, so I can probably get away with it.

But is permanent dye supposed to do that? I see mixed responses and nearly all of them assume that the permanent dye is to go blonde or something. To my knowledge, permanent blue dye is still a new thing which just adds to complexity.  Some say the stinging is normal but others say it‚Äôs an allergic reaction. 

I do patch tests with this stuff and haven‚Äôt noticed anything of concern. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a chemical burn because when I rinse out the dye, the stinging immediately stops.

If it helps, I have fine but thick, medium to light brown hair. Im trying to be careful because last week, I was switched from testosterone injections to temporarily using testosterone gel. Gel is known to cause baldness faster than injections, and while both sides of the family have full heads of hair in their 60s and 70s, I still don‚Äôt want to gamble with it.

If it‚Äôs not supposed to sting, I‚Äôm going to bite the bullet and return to semi-permanent. I know people say to leave all this to a cosmetologist but I‚Äôve tried ones in the county with mostly bad results. Whether it was damage to my skin/hair or just a bad dye job overall, I‚Äôve had less bad experiences by myself than with people around here.


UPDATE: So I tried the dye again without using bleach, and so far there‚Äôs no pain. I think I need to space out the intervals for the bleach/dye part.",NoStupidQuestions

For example, individuals like Ronen Rubinstein from 911 Lone Star, Ezra Miller, and Zach Rance from BB'16.

If there's something wrong with my post, please just tell me. Sorry if this is just something I should keep to myself, I just wanted to get other opinions on it because I'm nervous.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Context of my situation**  
\- I'm an adult living with 3 narcissistic and abusive people - 1 parent, 2 grandparents. My parent doesn't want me to be independent so I haven't been able to leave the house in months, with no signs of that changing. I haven't been able to get a ""real job"" as none of the many I applied to actually seem to be interesting in hiring people.

\- Recently the only stray cat I was close to was killed (by accident - I feel like I should also note it that it was a grandparent that killed it not me!) and I'm in desperate need of a companion, I just can't bare being here otherwise. There are other strays at the house but they don't come near me and I try to limit the time out of my room anyways.

\- This will be my first time adopting so I'm very new to the process. The application form I filled out had lots of personal questions like the birthdays and full names of people living in the home. After applying I got an email stating they would be doing a property check. At first I thought it just meant they were gonna look up the property on google maps, but after looking up info about adoptions I understand it means they'll be coming to the house.

I have several concerns + questions presented below.

  
***tldr: I'm an adult living with abusive hoarders, can't leave the house and unemployed. Cat died so I want a companion. Property check will be done. I have several concerns and questions.***

  
**I live with hoarders**  
There's lots of junk and food sitting outside and inside the house, key guest areas are mostly presentable but from you can definately tell there's a problem.

  
Will they be satisfied if I just direct them to my organized room where I plan on keeping the cat or will they want to check inside every room and around outside?

  
**I'm unemployed**  
I make money online but didn't mention it as it's not consistent and I didn't want questions about it.

Will they have a problem with me being unemployed? We have plenty of cat food and the person I mentioned in the application works constantly. I have saved enough money to purchase neccesities, and ubers + tip to and back from the humane society if need be.

  
**I don't have transportation**  
As mentioned before they don't like my leaving the house or being independent. I live in rural country so I can't just walk.  


I'm prepared to pay for an uber but I was wondering if it would be weird if I asked if they could deliver the cat to me? I would be willing to pay them for the trip + tip like I would pay uber.

  
**I don't have a traditional vet**  
There is someone that comes by and takes the cat to the vet for free whenever we have trouble. I didn't provide her number becuase I didn't know it, my parent is the one that communicates with her. I didn't want to ask her either because she always brushes me off and would've got upset at me for even daring to talk to her.

  
I am prepared to take my cat to the traditional vet if I need to, but I'd need to save up if it costs money to register with them or whatever you do. Honestly our current situation would work out in the case of an emergency, but I'm assuming that it's not sufficient enough.

  
**Made some mistakes on the form**  
\- I made some embarrassing mistakes on the form like leaving the roomates section blank because I wasn't thinking of them as roomates I had.  
\- I only mentioned my parent because I don't know the grandparent's full names or birthdays and due to reasons above I wasn't going to ask them.  
\- I mispelled the cat's name & used a different name entirely by accident.

  
Should I just consider myself fucked or is it possible it won't come up/ will be understandable mistakes? I wonder if I'm better of going to breeder but I can't afford it.

  
**Thank you for reading and I appreciate any advice, help or general support that's provided.**

Recently, She's been busy and preoccupied with various things in her life. During our early days we would talk 3-4 times a week, mostly video calls. She would reply to my texts sometimes. But these days we barely talk at all and she doesn't respond to my texts either. We did get to talk a couple of weeks ago and she apologized a lot - told me she's sick and dealing with other things and she'll make things better soon. She even said she knows I'm worried about this situation and she isn't planning to leave me/ghost me.

All of this is causing me to overthink a lot.

I see one of two situations:
1. She's not really interested in me anymore (I did make my intentions pretty clear early on that I do want this to end up in a marriage or a similar commitment. We met on a dating site after all). She was just being nice to me and continues to be nice to me, but thats all it is. I should back off and accept this.
2. Given she's not a phone person, and given she has said she's dealing with a lot in life right now, I should just continue to give her space, be patient and be there for her. If I really want to marry her, I should treat her problems as my own, and right now the only thing I can do for her problems is give her the time and space to deal with them.

I genuinely like her a lot but I feel I'm reaching the end of my patience. I've been ghosted a lot in the past and this does seem similar. However given what I know of her, and given what she's said, I don't think she's ghosting.

I don't know what to do. I don't have any close friends/family to talk to about this and seek advice. Hence here I am. Asking advice to random strangers on the Internet. Thank you in advance!",NoStupidQuestions

527,1697341725.0,Living to Work VS Working to Live ? What is the middle way?,"Living to work:  
Being able to find how good you can be in a field of your interest takes dedication into your career. Which means less attention will be placed in the social aspects of your life, and starting and maintaining a fruitful relationship with an SO may be less likely. But to know the full extent of your abilities, to find your passion into your subject of choice, comes with its own satisfaction.  
  
Working to Live:  
Finding any well paying career, travelling the world, creating beautiful relationships and experiences makes a life rich. You won't have to worry about not being satisfied living a life like that, however, for me that ""what if"" will be always in the back of my mind. Sure, you can let go of thoughts like those and just live in the present. But being a drifter in the world with no passion except for the passion they have for others, gives a sense of having no role in anything.

529,1697341539.0,Could there be two colors that look almost the same normally and quite different when viewing the negative?,"As a kid I read video game magazines and they always came with a CD full of demos and random crap, including fan art. I remember one one of the CDs there was some digital art of a cartoon dog and if I remember correctly the background was some kind of beige. For whatever reason I inverted the colors of the image and there was a secret message written in the background. I don't remember the message but I remember that it was pretty much impossible to see normally but quite easy to read when the colors were inverted.

I tried replicating it without much luck. All I could find online is that this can't really be possible and yet I'm convinced I saw it. I'm assuming the hidden text would have been 1 pixel wide, and the background may not have been a flat color, so I'm thinking that something like a light beige and a yellow might look very similar normally but the darker colors when inverted would have made it easier to separate the two? This would have been in the late 90s, I wasn't using any special program to view the pictures.

One pipe is held up by a nail. Is that normal? Am I overthinking this? 

I'm just worried I'm making a deal out of nothing. I don't know if it's normal for pipes to maybe leak a little out over time and the cabinets just soak up the stench?

I know (or I think?) I can spray the pipes with soapy water to see if there's a leak, but I'm almost scared to find out, because I would be the one left having to fix it and I don't know how to!

598,1697335936.0,Do you think society dismissed Christianity to make people weak?,"No stupid questions so here goes, i‚Äôve been thinking about this recently. I‚Äôve always been an atheist(?) but I do think that most religions (that i‚Äôm aware of, I am not well versed in every religion) are probably all based around things that may have happened and stories of people that may have existed and done good/ bad things although I have struggled to see the ‚ÄúGod‚Äù side of things. 
I know there have always been issues and horrific things throughout human history no matter of religions existence but I think that I was influenced growing up to dismiss Christianity even at school I was taught about it but there was never a drive or push towards any belief which i know they can‚Äôt do at school because it‚Äôs about education and not opinion (well it‚Äôs meant to be although it doesn‚Äôt seem that way anymore) 
I feel like since Christianity became less popular that our standards of how we act as people has seriously declined. Was it the case that older people were scared of doing bad things because of God? I‚Äôm not saying that religion makes you perfect and as I already said i don‚Äôt consider myself religious at all but have our standards fallen since we dropped mainstream Western Christianity? 
And the headline question, do you think this could be a bigger thing because the only things that seem to have ever brought people together no matter your background have been money and religion. 
I watched kingdom of heaven (a movie about the crusades) and upon further research the fact that a thousand years ago so many countries were brought together to fight side by side by Christianity alone is impressive and nothing like that has ever happened since? Money is only available to few who can pay people to support them but religion is basically free to everybody and could bring people together as it has in history.
Do you think that it‚Äôs a wanted thing to dissolve mass belief in the Western world to get rid of another thing that could bond people in numbers that are concerning to the powers that be?

Probably worded that horrendously but i‚Äôve been trying to talk to my pals about it but they don‚Äôt really have opinions except for saying ‚Äúreligion is a joke, people who believe a magic man made everything are stupid‚Äù It‚Äôs not relevant if any of it is true imo when i see religious people having higher standards of the way people should be.

I could play the audio, speak, or whatever, and only the players who are supposed to hear it will hear it. Nobody knows what was needed to be rolled in order to hear this, therefore, none of players knows that another player heard something that they didn't, likewise, the players who did hear something wouldn't know the other players didn't hear it.

And I need to close and open up laptop by HOLDING POWER BUTTON (which basically doesnt turn it off but completly cuts energy) until it finally open up but with working keyboard.
I dont have money for new laptop (+this laptop is really good gaming Lenovo Legion laptop) and buying a new motherboard doesnt worj either because its so expensive that it would be better for me to just buy a new laptop XD.

But going back to the main topic:
Will shutting down a PC like that everytime keyboard doesn't work will hurt my pc and performance in games?
Will it make damage? 
I tried to fix it and I even paid proffesional to fix it but they said I need to replace motherboard. 
So I just want to ask: will shutting laptop like that will damage it?

704,1697328330.0,Is it possible that a teenager deployed an EMP on my home security system for the sole purpose of ding dong ditching my house?,"I know that sounds absurd but here‚Äôs what happened. This afternoon at 3:09 PM, my doorbell rang. Soon after, I saw a teenager absolutely booking it away from my house. Playing ding dong ditch. No big deal, we were all kids once.

As it happens though, I recently had a camera installed by my front door, which allows playback within the past 24 hours. On a whim, and mostly in the interest of testing out my new camera system, I decide to pull up the video of the kid ringing my doorbell. Here‚Äôs where it gets weird though.

I know for a FACT the time it happened. I also know the camera‚Äôs clock is set correctly. But I watched the entirety of 3:09, and there‚Äôs nothing. No one comes up to ring the bell. I check 3:08 and 3:10, on the off chance the clock is slightly off, but of course it‚Äôs not, and I find nothing. That‚Äôs when I notice something.

At precisely 3:09:13, the camera feed freezes. The clock stops, everything stops moving. A short while later at 3:09:25, it resumes and plays normally. The only possibility is that this kid ding dong ditched my house during this 12 second window. Given how fast they did it, it‚Äôs entirely possible that they were able to get in, ding dong, and subsequently ditch within this narrow time frame.

Which begs the question. Is this just the biggest coincidence ever (my cameras have never done anything of the sort before), or was the camera failure a deliberate stealth tactic by whom I can only assume is the teenage version of Jason Bourne? How is that even possible?",NoStupidQuestions

I used to love the DC comic Strange Sports Stories. Whether it was playing hockey against a vengeful ghost, tennis with a live grenade or pole vaulting through time, it was awesome. I also loved the game parts of Rollerball, in the way only a bloodthirsty kid who doesn‚Äôt care about social commentary can. And who didn‚Äôt enjoy watching the Harlem Globetrotters finally figure out how to beat those pesky robots?

I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs what i expected the future of sports to look like, but i thought new sports would be exciting at least. Instead we‚Äôve got the dystopia future where corporations and billionaires are running everything into the ground, but instead of futuristic sports they‚Äôve apparently decided to replace horseshoes with cornhole and something called ladderball, as if children flinging rusty hunks of iron at each other is a bad thing.

Im a guy in my mid 20s. Back in high school I was a sex machine. I got head a lot and had sex at a very early age. Super early bloomer. Anyways, post high school everything changed. I never got a girlfriend again, and at best all I ever got was talking stages with women. Not for lack of trying. Since highschool I have tried with all my might to have any sort of girlfriend, and it has just never worked out. Friend zoning, ghosting, all of it has happened to me. All of it except for it working out.

I‚Äôm not ugly. I‚Äôve been called attractive a lot. I have great hair, a nice smile. I‚Äôm not rich. I‚Äôm poor. But I know that rarely matters, just again giving more detail. I don‚Äôt live with my parents. I am really creative and have made some impressive creative achievements. I like to consider myself as empathetic and motivated. I constantly spend hours daily thinking on how to better myself. I work out. What I‚Äôm trying to say is I think I‚Äôd fit the idea of a catch to some people. 

Despite all of this, I am invisible to women. Dating apps don‚Äôt work for me. Going to clubs with my friends doesn‚Äôt work either. My friends (who I will add are on the same level of good looking as me if not below; I know thats a scummy thing to say but I‚Äôm just trying to paint a picture of my confusion. They‚Äôre great people. I am shorter than all of them. I‚Äôm a short guy. But I‚Äôve seen guys shorter than me get laid.) will get all the attention while I‚Äôm approaching women only for them to walk away when I do or act like I‚Äôm an annoyance on their day. Which fine yeah they don‚Äôt owe me anything but what is driving me crazy is just that I don‚Äôt get why thats what happens. I like to find solutions to problems. I like to improve. And yet I can never fix this issue in my life. 

I will add I am mentally ill. I have been hospitalized before unfortunately. I go to therapy. I suffer from some diagnosed illnesses. Nothing reality distorting. Just depression adhd etc.

I hear all kinds of things from friends. ‚ÄúYou overthink too much‚Äù or ‚Äúyou have to work on your self esteem‚Äù or whatever. That‚Äôs cool man but I try to adapt myself everytime I hear these things. Try to fix them. I listen to advice. I try to do different things. I try to fix my problems. None of it has helped.

So what is it? What is my issue? When will this nightmare end? Sometimes I joke that the universe has this rule where it has forbidden me to find a hook-up or a relationship or marriage or whatever. Maybe as karma or a joke. I don‚Äôt know. Nothing else makes sense. I can‚Äôt find an answer. I just feel like I‚Äôd save myself so much mental pain if I accepted being single as my fate. Its like having this hope that theres an answer out there is what causes the pain. If I just stopped hoping and accepted defeat then I‚Äôd stop being let down or caring. I want to stop. But my friends don‚Äôt let me. They say one day it will happen. That I‚Äôm such a doomer or pessimist. But I don‚Äôt see it that way. All evidence points to the contrary. Years of rejection. It won‚Äôt stop. I don‚Äôt get it. It gets to the point with my friends where I feel like they just keep telling me to keep going because it makes them laugh to see me continue to try.

Then it started feeling weird, like kind of squishy, squishier than normal, thats when I got up to go to the mirror. I realized I couldn't see the outline of my contact, and I fished it out from the back of my eyelid.

So my two questions are:

1. Can I still use the contact I got out of my eye, or should I throw it out? It was one of those monthly ones, and not at the end of its use.

2. Is my eyeball going to be ok?? It started feeling weird as I was poking and prodding at it, thinking it was my contact. Like I said, I literally picked up the skin of my eyeball too. Right now it just feels irritated and itchy.",NoStupidQuestions

760,1697324298.0,Catching bosses right hand drinking at work,"Second hand story - Me and the witnessing party (Joe) have complete opposite beliefs on what should take place.

Joe has been working there for about a year. Is friendly with people around them but is not nearly as well acquainted with the boss.

Right hand (John) was not explicitly caught drinking but a strong smell of spirits was smelt as they were walking by, being the only other person in the office - as well as being every now and then quite difficult to understand, leads to believe they might be drinking at work. John exhibits on and off slurred speech and is difficult to understand, some days he speaks perfectly fine. Joe is not a native english speaker and was quicker to blame themselves for poor understanding.

*What should happen now*

I believe something like this should be reported to the Boss. Not in any malicious way, no harm has been done and it is safe to assume that this is not having an impact on John's work.
I look at this situation from the point of view of the Boss. I would like to know information like this, no matter how likely it is to be true. I would also gain respect for Joe, of course if they were to handle this tastefully.

Joe believes that this is sticking your nose into someone's else's business. They are not friendly with the boss, they find it unlikely that the Boss would not know of something like this, they work closely together and if it was a big issue it would have been known by now.

I would also like to clear up that i can't paint the full picture of how uncomfortable a situation like this would be for Joe and so I can't name any other tangible reasons to support Joe's side because there are a lot of unspoken emotions at play.

840,1697317784.0,why am i the only one that's stupid,"Maybe this could be seen as a rant but it's both tbh.

I started going to driving school for B category last week. It was absolute hell. I am stuck on couple things that i don't understand and no matter how much i re-read all we wrote i still can't understand it properly nor remember it. I also get headaches a lot it's literally only when I'm there. We usually are there for like 2h 35min or like 3h 30min. 

I feel so fucking stupid. I'm the only girl there, there's like 5-6 of us. I feel like I'm the only one who understands nothing. When we practice answering questions i always stay silent when answers are revealed because i realize how many mistakes i actually make and its mostly the ones others got correct. Last time i didn't even bother reading nor understanding much i hated it and felt so low. Few times the instructor (also a woman) said like ""this is harder for us girls"" or ""especially girls need to be careful"" it's like i don't care but it's humiliating why am i the only one that has to be especially careful when driving behind trucks or going around cars? 

Also when they talk about like car brands and types idk i just don't understand anything and everyone else does like i can tell you what color it is or if it's passat or citroen but that's it. Add some numbers or letters or other words? Goodbye. It's so embarrassing. 

I don't know why it's taking such a toll on me tbh it's not that deep but it is and I'm paying money for it i don't want to fail and lose it all but it's so hard i hate it. 

I genuinely don't know what to do or how to get better. I'm definitely not gonna tell if I'm wrong because I'm introverted and shy so hell no but I'm at a loss. 

What am i supposed to do? I literally have only 1 day to learn what we did in 6. Ig my best way of learning is basically re-writing everything we wrote till now but idk if i should write in a new notebook where i understand it better (i used one where i wrote it all shitty cus it was just for the beginning but i had not time to re-write) or should i after every lesson write it on my computer and print it out? Maybe i will have easier access and it'll be easier to read? Or to just use a notebook? How to even practice all this properly? I'm really sorry i hope this is right sub reddit for this i don't know where else to post it.

845,1697317600.0,Can I report an employer having us put in fake lunch breaks and urging employees to turn in timesheets with hours before working (and then making them work over those hours) in the state of California?,"What the title says. I work once a week for a public university's law school and work 6+ hours.

As far as I'm aware, in the state of California we have the right to a 10 minute rest break and a 30 minute lunch break. My employer does not offer us a lunch break and has us work straight through, they then ask us to falsify our timesheets by adding in an hour lunch break and putting in an extra hour of work to make up for that hour of pay.

They also ask us to turn in our timesheets before we work and often ask us to log the hours 7-12..  our program always goes til 1 or later, however the official hours are to 12. They ask us to change our timesheets after the fact which is a long process (I'm assuming to delay payday)... I don't do this, I just wait and log my time after work is over.

It's a teaching job with highschoolers. They allow us to work before we have had the livescan (fingerprint scan/background check and confirmation of eligibility to work in the US) which I also believe is illegal.

We also had an incident last year with one of our co-workers talking inappropriately with a highschooler. They did nothing about the situation. It happened again and they lied multiple times saying they did something, changing the story to ""we didn't know"", ""we did something just no one told you"", ""we didn't do something the first time but the second time we did"". In the end, they asked us to no longer report these incidents as we should ""trust our boss""...

All the hobbies I was addicted to seem pointless. I used to LOVE my job now I'm about to resign because it seems stupid and I don't want to leave the house.   


All I feel like I can do is lay on the floor/bed and cry. But I'm crying without a reason, it feels so strange.

And I can't really remember anything that's happening. Like yesterday feels like a dream.

Can depression just come on suddenly like that? And without a reason? (If yeah, what should I do? I can't afford therapy or anything like that, have crap insurance.)

The whole memory of getting the tattoo is really special to me (stick n poke in a punk rock trailer in the desert in the rain with new sweet friends and a budding love story - with someone who ended up treating me as bad as it gets without killing me, but I still endear the beginning stages of that adventure). It‚Äôs a symbol of survival and also how I claimed my own power when I entered that time, and also when I walked away. However, no one in my family or friends likes it. I honestly feel insecure about it. If it were surrounded by other tattoos I wouldn‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs all by itself on my arm. Also, it‚Äôs not the arm I wish it were on. The dislike for the tattoo is palpable from my family. I know how it sounds to say all this and that many folks would tell me that it‚Äôs my body and to keep it if I like it, but my truest friends feel sad when they see it, albeit confused (and that‚Äôs ok). I hope I see the artist again because we‚Äôre friends now although in different places, and I worry how she would feel, or rather, how I feel about removing it. The artist did a good job and she did what I asked her to.

What ingredient(s) should I shop for in the future that's in the 'good' wash or avoid that's in the 'bad' wash?


I usually use Dove ""Cucumber and Green Tea"" body wash, but when it was out of stock at my store the other month I had to substitute with Dove ""Sensitive Skin hypoallergenic"". The cucumber one clings to my skin long enough in the shower for me to squirt with one hand and then lather on my skin with the other hand (I don't use a loofah or washcloth, though maybe I should. that's outside the scope of this question tho). Or long enough to start lathering, realize I forgot to brace my leg on the edge of the tub, move my leg up, and then continue lathering.

But the sensitive skin one sometimes slides right off my body in that split second right after I've squirted it?? So I've had to start carefully cupping each squirt and start lathering it in the palm of my hand immediately, otherwise the glob of it often drop onto the tub floor and go to waste. It also tends more toward staying in the original squirts/globs and needs more force for me to work it into my skin when I *do* catch runaways in time.


I'm assuming one of the culprit ingredients is gonna be well-known-ish, but when I Google for the differences intra-body-wash all I get are results about the differences between bar soap and body wash ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

I get kids don't always understand the adult logic. But so many times I see parents who treat their kids like dumb animals. Like they hate their own children. Like they don't recall what it's like to be small and new to the world. 

I remember vividly what it's like to be a powerless child, yanked around, screamed at, etc. Am I an outlier here? 

Why do people treat their kids like this? Why don't they have empathy for their innocent toddler, who knows nothing of how the world works?

Let's say this person turns 19, and their prescription is now 5.

We know that some individuals can only receive LASIK or PRK once in their lifetime, while others may be eligible for multiple surgeries. 

So, why isn't the surgery performed on the 15-year-old to potentially reduce their prescription back to 0? Then, when they're 19, it might not be as high as 5, possibly a 3 or less.

Everyone has their own opinion on remakes, this isn't that debate, but there are animated films that are widely and wildly requested to be remade (even in live action) but because the original film ""flopped"" it's not a priority, if it's on the radar at all. My mental rabbit whole dug itself deeper when I realized that an entire industry is compromised of basically 40+ aged men and is trying to direct you to what they think is what. We've had this weird trend of a bunch of old men complaining that the avengers aren't the godfather, animation isn't ""cinema"" kind of thing and I feel like it's going to negatively influence today's cult classics going forward. 

My anecdotal example is going to be Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001). It's a huge fan favorite, and it had less than stellar reception on release and is considered a ""flop"". Despite some pretty vocal support, it doesn't appear to be on anyone's radar at all in terms of remakes or continuation.

Career wise, I have little hope of staying in the same field.

Full tuition academic undergrad scholarship, 4.0GPA from high school to grad school, all the bullshit effort that goes into trying to ""follow your heart"" and make a career, and today I had to make a trip to the pawn shop and the plasma center just to make it to payday.

I don't know how someone gets out of this. I don't know whether it's the country or the whole world. I just want to get off the low part of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and I don't know how.

I didn't intend for every poem to be about him but at least 85% of the book is direct love poetry about my feelings for him, good, and frustrated, and sort of falling in love with someone whose ""social station"" is above yours.

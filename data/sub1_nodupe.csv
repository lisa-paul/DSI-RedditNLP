Basically, I like in Minnesota, and I(M25) bought a car due to having my previous car totaled last year around late March 2022. I ended up getting my temporary title and registration, and plates from the dealership. The thing was, I never got it insured because around a week later I had gotten a promotion at work and then was given a personal vehicle for use. I was very tight on money (and dumb) and decided not to insure it since I had the work vehicle, didn’t need to use my newly bought car, not put as many miles on it, and figured I would insure it once I had some more breathing room. I forgot about it and now, I haven’t gotten the new title that was supposed to be mailed by the dmv, plus the temporary one expired.

For example pointers will point at prey without ever being taught, by instinct. My English cocker spaniel when he was young chased and pinned down a chicken -- without harming it, and waited for me to come get it. You have the Spanish water dog that loves water, terriers that dig for rats, pitbulls and mastiffs who will lock their jaws into prey. 

How did we select for that? Pointers to me really illustrate my point (pun intended). How did I find two dogs that would take a very specific and unnatural position to indicate to me the direction of a bird? And how did I get their descendants to inherit that trait?

Unfortunately every article either dives into deep details or completely skims over operating principles.  It seems like the idea is that solar heat evaporates some water vapor. Then the water vapor condenses and is collected, and releases heat. That much makes sense. But these 'multistage' stills seem to be based on the idea of collecting the heat of condensation evaporate more water? 

What I don't understand is--for the water vapor to condense, it has to be touching a surface below the boiling point. Ergo, if the water is hot enough to evaporate, the water vapor can't condense and add more heat to it. If it's cool enough for the water vapor to condense on it and warm it up, it's because the temp is low enough that evaporation isn't occurring...

I’m a fan of physics and have read books on SR so I think my understanding is just a couple steps shy of it clicking in (I hope). I know it has to do with how gravity travels at the speed of light and as, say, a planet moves through space it will generate gravitational waves moving away from it (similar to a boats wake maybe? The waves in each direction are not moving at equal speed relative to the object maybe?). I think Frame Dragging comes in when the object is spinning, fast? 

Perhaps where I start to lose it is when length contraction is explained (which is ironic as I own an electrical construction company). The wiki says a wheel moving forward at (near) the speed of light (or rolling forward moving at C?? It doesn’t specify which?) has the top going near C, but the *speed at the bottom is always zero*. WTF? How can a wheel rotate with the bottom not rotating?

There was also a reference to how a gyroscope spins being similar to the same effect which is why the object has to spin fast for the effect to be relevant. I barely understand gyroscopes in the sense that it’s a conservation of angular momentum. Always running forward and pushing the other direction giving it its force to wanting to stay in position but anything beyond that is above my pay grade. 

I learn best visually if that helps. I’ve tried to wrap my head around some things then when someone pops a gif of the idea/object in motion my brain goes, “Well why didn’t you just say that? Of COURSE it works that way!” (And then I feel dumb for not being able to visualize it. Once it clicks though I’m down to clown)

Why not just use joules for total amount of energy used and watts for consistent/average output over a specific time? I assume watt-hours is how many watts are consistently produced over an hour period but it is used often in unhelpful scenarios. When talking about say solar generation, someone could say ""my solar array produces 12kWh every day"". So 12kWh for 24 hours means your solar array produces 0.5kW of power for the entire day. How was watt-hours helpful in anyway to describe the solar array's power output? 

Or when talking about a cities power output, the reports are measured in Gigawatt-hours over the entire year. Why is quantifying a cities yearly output over an hour long period helpful?

Now if we compare the 2 given examples, it becomes even more confusing. If I had a solar array that produces 12kWh every day, how many solar arrays would I need to power a city the needs 5000 GWh every year? 5000 GWh every year is around 570.78 MW, so if I just used the standard watts over watt-hours I would have a simple convertion between scenarios while still having the option to say ""0.5kWs each day"" or ""570.78MWs for a year"".

Why don't objects slow down naturally?,"I understand why it needs to exist, otherwise the Earth wouldn't keep spinning, coins would fall over immediately when you tried spinning them, artificial gravity wouldn't be possible, etc. But I'm not sure how it works out physically. (nb. I'm talking without regard to drag, friction, etc. For example out in space where those are negligible factors.)

By definition, a spinning object is under acceleration (individual points on the object are constantly turning around the center of rotation, which is a form of acceleration in linear physics). And force requires energy, so why doesn't the spinning of an object expend its angular momentum and slow it down over time?

Along the same vein, how does artificial gravity work in this context? As I understand it, centrifugal force is a fictitious force, but if I am inside a spinning object I am still being pressed against it as it turns and subjected to acceleration (from an observer's point of view, at least). And so since I am being accelerated, something has to be using energy to accelerate me, right?

Businesses increase their prices.  

OR  

Businesses increase quantity supplied.    

&#x200B;

I believe (correct me) that Keynes's assumption was that businesses would undergo capital/labor investment and a degree of 'risk' (however distorted that may be) to increase the quantity that they supply. It seems to me, that upon an increase in AD, that there might be a stronger incentive to simply increase prices to get the best returns out of that new demand.  

Example:  Assume that I have a donut shop and i am faced with, overnight, a doubling from 100 people to 200 people wanting to buy a donut at my pre-AD-increase prices. I can either incur cost and risk to make twice as many donuts (assuming I make exactly the amount of donuts I sell), or just ask my local micro-economist to tell me what the highest price I could charge for my current quantity maximum of 100 donuts is. Which plan of action would you recommend to the donut owner?    

The situation above, of course, focuses on an isolation of increased AD - it does not include any mention of competition. My intuition is that, if the donut market is perfectly competitive, then the labor investment and innovation in that market stays the same before AD and after AD. Upon the initial increase, prices will increase. If there is a viable investment that would increase quantity supplied and lower prices to compete better and incurr demand from more people - and increase overall efficiency in that economy - than would it be made regardless of changes in aggregate demand?

Im sure the answer to this is simple and that i'm just kind of slow, this is just where my train of thought has led me I guess.",explainlikeimfive

When films, particularly full CGI films, are made, do they truly make it frame by frame? Or do they desgin the full 3d world and put cameras into the software to ""film"" the scene? And how extensive to they get? 

For example, in the car chase ending for Toy Story, would they have designed and modeled the entire neighborhood and used ""cameras"" in the scene to film it? Would they fully 3d model each house and ""play"" the scene to film it? Or would they design and create small pieces and put them together like traditional cartoon?

Might be time to start training for larger, and irregular meals. Might be worth seeing if that leads to more and less productive days. (So I could focus harder on important stuff, and on off days just do stuff like laundry.)

Edit 2: I've seen lots of comments about the obesity epidemic. That's not what I'm referring to. Eating 20% more food than you should every single day will make you fat.I'm asking more about how to lions eat upwards of 1,000% food required for a single day at infrequent intervals.

Unfortunately every article either dives into deep details or completely skims over operating principles.  It seems like the idea is that solar heat evaporates some water vapor. Then the water vapor condenses and is collected, and releases heat. That much makes sense. But these 'multistage' stills seem to be based on the idea of collecting the heat of condensation evaporate more water? 

What I don't understand is--for the water vapor to condense, it has to be touching a surface below the boiling point. Ergo, if the water is hot enough to evaporate, the water vapor can't condense and add more heat to it. If it's cool enough for the water vapor to condense on it and warm it up, it's because the temp is low enough that evaporation isn't occurring...

576,818,1695994654.0,eli5 What is Frame Dragging in physics,"There are a only couple very old answers on this sub that seemed to skip a few key points so I hope it’s ok to ask for a better explanation?

I’m a fan of physics and have read books on SR so I think my understanding is just a couple steps shy of it clicking in (I hope). I know it has to do with how gravity travels at the speed of light and as, say, a planet moves through space it will generate gravitational waves moving away from it (similar to a boats wake maybe? The waves in each direction are not moving at equal speed relative to the object maybe?). I think Frame Dragging comes in when the object is spinning, fast? 

Perhaps where I start to lose it is when length contraction is explained (which is ironic as I own an electrical construction company). The wiki says a wheel moving forward at (near) the speed of light (or rolling forward moving at C?? It doesn’t specify which?) has the top going near C, but the *speed at the bottom is always zero*. WTF? How can a wheel rotate with the bottom not rotating?

There was also a reference to how a gyroscope spins being similar to the same effect which is why the object has to spin fast for the effect to be relevant. I barely understand gyroscopes in the sense that it’s a conservation of angular momentum. Always running forward and pushing the other direction giving it its force to wanting to stay in position but anything beyond that is above my pay grade.

605,867,1695898744.0,eli5: How is the use of watt-hours useful?,"I'm confused why the term watt-hours (Wh) is used. Watts is joules per second. So watt-hours is joules per second for a hour. There are 2 time measurements within the same term.

Why not just use joules for total amount of energy used and watts for consistent/average output over a specific time? I assume watt-hours is how many watts are consistently produced over an hour period but it is used often in unhelpful scenarios. When talking about say solar generation, someone could say ""my solar array produces 12kWh every day"". So 12kWh for 24 hours means your solar array produces 0.5kW of power for the entire day. How was watt-hours helpful in anyway to describe the solar array's power output? 

Or when talking about a cities power output, the reports are measured in Gigawatt-hours over the entire year. Why is quantifying a cities yearly output over an hour long period helpful?

Now if we compare the 2 given examples, it becomes even more confusing. If I had a solar array that produces 12kWh every day, how many solar arrays would I need to power a city the needs 5000 GWh every year? 5000 GWh every year is around 570.78 MW, so if I just used the standard watts over watt-hours I would have a simple convertion between scenarios while still having the option to say ""0.5kWs each day"" or ""570.78MWs for a year"".

They are increasing interest rates, but then they are having the reserve ratio at 0% and they are engaging in reverse repo to make sure that banks have plenty of cash. I don't get it.  


edit: thank you for all the answers. Got that the reverse repo was the opposite of what I was thinking (the whole thing is a bit confusing). I still don't completely understand why reserve ratio is at 0% and it does make me wonder about if the fed (owned by banks) is doing it this way because it results in better returns for the banks than if they were to increase the reserve ratio. Like in my mind, increasing the reserve ratio is the obvious answer because 0% is obviously not smart. Like where we are seeing bank failures occurring this year, which makes sense to me since they have had three years to live recklessly. I get that monetary policy is influenced differently today, but I feel like the reserve ratio is a valid safeguard where it makes me frustrated that it isn't in place. ",explainlikeimfive

Why don't objects slow down naturally?,"I understand why it needs to exist, otherwise the Earth wouldn't keep spinning, coins would fall over immediately when you tried spinning them, artificial gravity wouldn't be possible, etc. But I'm not sure how it works out physically. (nb. I'm talking without regard to drag, friction, etc. For example out in space where those are negligible factors.)

By definition, a spinning object is under acceleration (individual points on the object are constantly turning around the center of rotation, which is a form of acceleration in linear physics). And force requires energy, so why doesn't the spinning of an object expend its angular momentum and slow it down over time?

Along the same vein, how does artificial gravity work in this context? As I understand it, centrifugal force is a fictitious force, but if I am inside a spinning object I am still being pressed against it as it turns and subjected to acceleration (from an observer's point of view, at least). And so since I am being accelerated, something has to be using energy to accelerate me, right?

The pull-down system:  
NMOS transistors connect to GND only when it receives 1 as its input. (This is contradictory to how we want the function to connect to GND when it's logically false).  
To implement: negate the original function to get Fn. When f = 1, Fn = 0, it won't connect to GND. But when f = 0, Fn = 1, it will connect to GND. This works.

  
Here is my problem. Implementing the pull-up network.  
Firstly, PMOS and NMOS must be complements (they cannot be on the same time, I get that). But if we take the compliment of Fn, we get back the original function.   
Here is what I don't understand.   
PMOS needs to receive a 0 to connect to Vdd.  But if we Fp = f logically, when f is = 1, Fp is = 1, so we don't connect to Vdd...It needs to be 0.   
I get that when we negate Fn to get Fp, we are logically getting back f, but we are inverting the inputs and taking the dual. Fp, while logically equivalent to f, is not the same circuit as f.

But then why would the kidneys for example want to raise blood pressure in other areas? Like, just high blood pressure in general, say,  in the arteries. Why constrict those? Why would you want that? I kind of understand how blood pressure = cardiac output x resistance. Wouldn't that mean blood flow goes down? Increasing resistance to increase blood pressure?

Unfortunately every article either dives into deep details or completely skims over operating principles.  It seems like the idea is that solar heat evaporates some water vapor. Then the water vapor condenses and is collected, and releases heat. That much makes sense. But these 'multistage' stills seem to be based on the idea of collecting the heat of condensation evaporate more water? 

What I don't understand is--for the water vapor to condense, it has to be touching a surface below the boiling point. Ergo, if the water is hot enough to evaporate, the water vapor can't condense and add more heat to it. If it's cool enough for the water vapor to condense on it and warm it up, it's because the temp is low enough that evaporation isn't occurring...

It's different from heavily centralised states like the Eastern Bloc communist states where everything was owned by the State, and it's also different from ""usual"" modern states where maybe (depending on the state) a few enterprises and services (for example, health is a variable: see the case of USA) are nationalised, then you have Ministries or equivalent structures that regulate and enforce the law upon various sectors of activity, both private and public (and I'm not even entering the issues of external affairs, military and politicing, let's say that one's easy).
All I understand is that there were these state corporations and they were controlled by the state in some way or another, but that's it. So how did these state corporations work in Portugal? Were they public or private? What was their relationship to smaller private enterprise (canneries I get, but everything else)? What was deemed public property? What was the structure of the state, itself (since I understand Salazar was also a Minister for several departments simultaneously)? What were the main areas of public expenditure?

I’m a fan of physics and have read books on SR so I think my understanding is just a couple steps shy of it clicking in (I hope). I know it has to do with how gravity travels at the speed of light and as, say, a planet moves through space it will generate gravitational waves moving away from it (similar to a boats wake maybe? The waves in each direction are not moving at equal speed relative to the object maybe?). I think Frame Dragging comes in when the object is spinning, fast? 

Perhaps where I start to lose it is when length contraction is explained (which is ironic as I own an electrical construction company). The wiki says a wheel moving forward at (near) the speed of light (or rolling forward moving at C?? It doesn’t specify which?) has the top going near C, but the *speed at the bottom is always zero*. WTF? How can a wheel rotate with the bottom not rotating?

There was also a reference to how a gyroscope spins being similar to the same effect which is why the object has to spin fast for the effect to be relevant. I barely understand gyroscopes in the sense that it’s a conservation of angular momentum. Always running forward and pushing the other direction giving it its force to wanting to stay in position but anything beyond that is above my pay grade. 

I learn best visually if that helps. I’ve tried to wrap my head around some things then when someone pops a gif of the idea/object in motion my brain goes, “Well why didn’t you just say that? Of COURSE it works that way!” (And then I feel dumb for not being able to visualize it. Once it clicks though I’m down to clown)

I’ve looked it up and can understand that no body will ever be perfectly rigid, also that it is because information can not travel faster than light but still not finding a clear explanation as to why something can’t be perfectly rigid. Is it because atoms don’t form together rigidly? Therefore making it impossible? I’m really lost on this matter thanks :) (also don’t know if this is physics or not)

Edit : so I might understand now. From what I understand in the comments, atoms can not get close enough and stay close enough to become rigid I think, correct if wrong

563,813,1695898744.0,eli5: How is the use of watt-hours useful?,"I'm confused why the term watt-hours (Wh) is used. Watts is joules per second. So watt-hours is joules per second for a hour. There are 2 time measurements within the same term.

Why not just use joules for total amount of energy used and watts for consistent/average output over a specific time? I assume watt-hours is how many watts are consistently produced over an hour period but it is used often in unhelpful scenarios. When talking about say solar generation, someone could say ""my solar array produces 12kWh every day"". So 12kWh for 24 hours means your solar array produces 0.5kW of power for the entire day. How was watt-hours helpful in anyway to describe the solar array's power output? 

Or when talking about a cities power output, the reports are measured in Gigawatt-hours over the entire year. Why is quantifying a cities yearly output over an hour long period helpful?

Now if we compare the 2 given examples, it becomes even more confusing. If I had a solar array that produces 12kWh every day, how many solar arrays would I need to power a city the needs 5000 GWh every year? 5000 GWh every year is around 570.78 MW, so if I just used the standard watts over watt-hours I would have a simple convertion between scenarios while still having the option to say ""0.5kWs each day"" or ""570.78MWs for a year"".

By definition, a spinning object is under acceleration (individual points on the object are constantly turning around the center of rotation, which is a form of acceleration in linear physics). And force requires energy, so why doesn't the spinning of an object expend its angular momentum and slow it down over time?

Along the same vein, how does artificial gravity work in this context? As I understand it, centrifugal force is a fictitious force, but if I am inside a spinning object I am still being pressed against it as it turns and subjected to acceleration (from an observer's point of view, at least).

Tl;dr In a 230V distribution, why does measuring from line to line give 230V but line to neutral gives 120-130? And why the magical number sqr(3)? In my mind it should be 0.5 .. :p

If you focus on the black dots in the animation, this seems mathematically identical to taking the derivative of the shape at every possible point.

Like, I think I understand hydrostatic pressure. When it comes to the leaky vessels, you need more pressure to squeeze stuff out in those areas. And then osmosis or passive transport whatever balances things out again afterwards. That makes sense to me.  
  
But then why would the kidneys for example want to raise blood pressure in other areas? Like, just high blood pressure in general, say,  in the arteries. Why constrict those? Why would you want that? I kind of understand how blood pressure = cardiac output x resistance. Wouldn't that mean blood flow goes down? Increasing resistance to increase blood pressure?  
  
I mean, plus the damage that high blood pressure is supposed to do over time. And this is then on top of impeded blood flow. And so, I just keep hearing how various systems or vessels etc constrict to increase pressure on purpose. Why would the body want that?

So, first of all, architects study many years, and they study things like math, and science, and architecture is considered to be an art by many people, So, what kind of creativity, and knowledge of sciences does building a rectangle(cube) need?
Like, how, architecture can be related to creativity, and now i'm not talking about rectangles, and cubes, i'm talking about building that are usually considered to be an art, like creating a crappy sketch of a strange curvy thing, or round thing, or big thing, or maybe thing with a lot of cubes is considered to be creative, and architects aren't engineering who will blow their minds out to comprehend how to build that thing, and as i know architects have nothing to do with things like colors, plumbing, air systems, electricity systems, ceiling design, furniture, materials, and etc of a building.
Like they don’t go there and say ""this room will be blue, this room will be red, and that room will be yellow, electricity system will be like that, air system will be like that, sofas, and chair will be like that, doors, and stair will be like that, colors will be like that, chandeliers will be like that, toilets, and tiles will be like that, carpets, and curtains will be like that"" and etc, they don’t do it(as i know, or is it the opposite, and architect is the one who does all of that?)
and so if everything thing is like that, then why do architects study so many years, and they study things like math, and science, and architecture is considered to be a creative thing(art) and is considered to be very hard? (thanks, for reading my post)",explainlikeimfive

Unfortunately every article either dives into deep details or completely skims over operating principles.  It seems like the idea is that solar heat evaporates some water vapor. Then the water vapor condenses and is collected, and releases heat. That much makes sense. But these 'multistage' stills seem to be based on the idea of collecting the heat of condensation evaporate more water? 

What I don't understand is--for the water vapor to condense, it has to be touching a surface below the boiling point. Ergo, if the water is hot enough to evaporate, the water vapor can't condense and add more heat to it. If it's cool enough for the water vapor to condense on it and warm it up, it's because the temp is low enough that evaporation isn't occurring...

569,814,1695994654.0,eli5 What is Frame Dragging in physics,"There are a only couple very old answers on this sub that seemed to skip a few key points so I hope it’s ok to ask for a better explanation?

I’m a fan of physics and have read books on SR so I think my understanding is just a couple steps shy of it clicking in (I hope). I know it has to do with how gravity travels at the speed of light and as, say, a planet moves through space it will generate gravitational waves moving away from it (similar to a boats wake maybe? The waves in each direction are not moving at equal speed relative to the object maybe?). I think Frame Dragging comes in when the object is spinning, fast? 

Perhaps where I start to lose it is when length contraction is explained (which is ironic as I own an electrical construction company). The wiki says a wheel moving forward at (near) the speed of light (or rolling forward moving at C?? It doesn’t specify which?) has the top going near C, but the *speed at the bottom is always zero*. WTF? How can a wheel rotate with the bottom not rotating?

There was also a reference to how a gyroscope spins being similar to the same effect which is why the object has to spin fast for the effect to be relevant. I barely understand gyroscopes in the sense that it’s a conservation of angular momentum. Always running forward and pushing the other direction giving it its force to wanting to stay in position but anything beyond that is above my pay grade. 

I learn best visually if that helps. I’ve tried to wrap my head around some things then when someone pops a gif of the idea/object in motion my brain goes, “Well why didn’t you just say that? Of COURSE it works that way!” (And then I feel dumb for not being able to visualize it. Once it clicks though I’m down to clown)

Why not just use joules for total amount of energy used and watts for consistent/average output over a specific time? I assume watt-hours is how many watts are consistently produced over an hour period but it is used often in unhelpful scenarios. When talking about say solar generation, someone could say ""my solar array produces 12kWh every day"". So 12kWh for 24 hours means your solar array produces 0.5kW of power for the entire day. How was watt-hours helpful in anyway to describe the solar array's power output? 

Or when talking about a cities power output, the reports are measured in Gigawatt-hours over the entire year. Why is quantifying a cities yearly output over an hour long period helpful?

Now if we compare the 2 given examples, it becomes even more confusing. If I had a solar array that produces 12kWh every day, how many solar arrays would I need to power a city the needs 5000 GWh every year? 5000 GWh every year is around 570.78 MW, so if I just used the standard watts over watt-hours I would have a simple convertion between scenarios while still having the option to say ""0.5kWs each day"" or ""570.78MWs for a year"".

(nb. I'm talking without regard to drag, friction, etc. For example out in space where those are negligible factors.)

By definition, a spinning object is under acceleration (individual points on the object are constantly turning around the center of rotation, which is a form of acceleration in linear physics). And force requires energy, so why doesn't the spinning of an object expend its angular momentum and slow it down over time?

Along the same vein, how does artificial gravity work in this context? As I understand it, centrifugal force is a fictitious force, but if I am inside a spinning object I am still being pressed against it as it turns and subjected to acceleration (from an observer's point of view, at least). And so since I am being accelerated, something has to be using energy to accelerate me, right?

This is normally followed up by discussion of how bad America's medical system is, and act like these bills are the norm for anyone with health issues.

85,111,1697385051.0,Was is flirting etiquette?,"My whole life I’ve been taught by women, teachers, and online culture that I need to… I guess be careful when I talk to women? Sparingly talk to women? Idk it was never really clear.

I was kind of told it’s not ok to flirt with women because it’s sexual harassment or I’m making people uncomfortable. I’ve been also told the worst places to do it are at school, work, bars, and if I see a woman enjoying being out on her own anywhere, I also shouldn’t really bother her by flirting.

So I don’t really know what to do. I kind of just wait for them to say or start something because I don’t want to be a bad person or seen as creepy or overbearing. 

I also don’t know when it’s appropriate to touch them. Again I’ve always waited for them to do that. 

I’ve had long terms relationships. Upwards of 5 years. And at the start of each I would make sure not to even sit on the same couch as them because Im afraid they’d feel uncomfortable like I’ve always been told.

And as a single person idk if I’m flirting with someone or their just being friendly. Idk if I’m aloud to gently touch them here and there to show some slight physical intimacy. Like something as small as holding their back gently while walking through crowds. Or giving them a cute shove when they say something goofy or funny. Or holding their hand to compliment their nails or bracelet. 

And kissing is out of the question. I won’t do it until they straight up ask me. 

The risk of being a bad person is way greater then the reward of someone by chance being into me. 

So what’s the etiquette? How are you supposed to flirt? When is it ok to talk to women? When is it overdoing it? What should my expectations be? Should I just be friendly and wait for them to initiate something? Is it sexual harassment and I should just take the risk? What’s the line between friendly and intimate?

125,163,1697380973.0,Am I gonna get a girlfriend again? (OCD & relationship issues),"Hi all.  
  
I'm 23 years old and have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and lately I've been thinking I might have some mild psychosis too. I'm saying this because most of the time my thoughts drift away from what's real and sometimes no longer know what is the true thinking way. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist but most of the medication didn't work and therapy... Well... It didn't work that well either. I want to ask you a question about one part of my problems.  
  
I'm actually a normal person with most of the stuff in life but when it comes to relationships I just lose my mind and don't know & think what to do. What do I mean by this? I had 2 girlfriends until now. When I was 16 and 21. The first one didn't last longer. The second one lasted for 1,5 years. And now I can't find anybody else. And I'm thinking about the possibility of not being able to find a girlfriend for the rest of my life or a very long time like 5 years, 10 years, 15 years... This thought is driving me crazy and it's making me lose connection with the reality. I no longer can think properly. I'm thinking about all those worst case scenarios where being single forever or ""What if I'll never find anybody else?"", ""What if I'm unlucky or there's a spell over me that's gonna make it impossible for me to find another one?"", ""What if this?"", ""What if that?""...  
  
Having a girlfriend means a lot to me. I guess this is why I'm having these thoughts. I try to think like a normal person but it doesn't work:  
  
\- ""Of course I'll find somebody else. Everybody does.""  
\- ""I just need to get socialize, meet with people.""  
\- ""Nobody knows the future. It's very uncertain. I have to focus on now.""  
  
NO. Sadly these kind of ways of thinking don't help me at all. I have intolerance towards uncertainty and it's making me suffer a lot and I can't get that idea of being single forever out of my mind.   
  
English is my second language. I tried to do my best while writing. If there are some mistakes I'm sorry in advance.

**In short, my problem is that I'm afraid of the possibility of not getting another girlfriend. Is this possible?**  

Thank you.

139,179,1697379542.0,Does Fingerprinting Everybody All The Time Really Keep Anyone Safe?,"My brother's youngest just graduated from high school.  For like 15 years he's been a ""parent helper"" at the school, going in to paint sets for the high school plays and do all kinds of other stuff, band booster, basketball Dad, lots of things.  Every teacher in the place knows him (it's a small school and all four of his kids went there).

He no longer has any kids at the school, but some of the kids there are friends of his daughter who just graduated, and he's still friends with the other parents. The fall play is coming up, and so one of the other Drama Club Parents asked if he would be back to help out.  He said sure, and then the school board came up with like a dozen forms he has to fill out.  Proof of covid vaccination and some others, well, fine, but they never asked before.  And they want him to get fingerprinted and have a background check.

He thinks that's idiotic; he's been at the school longer than several of the school board members have been office.  And then we got to wondering: does taking all these fingerprints really have any positive effect on student safety, or is this just a way to funnel a bunch of money to companies that do background checks?

One point for him is that he has never been fingerprinted.  His prints aren't in any database anywhere.  If he does this, now they will be, and that's bothering him.  I told him it's no big deal; I had a job with a security clearance once and I'd been fingerprinted and had a background check.  He replied by mentioning cases where people were wrongly accused or convicted of crimes because a fingerprint at a crime scene was incorrectly matched with their fingerprint, which can only happen if your fingerprint is in a database somewhere.  Sure, it's rare (but maybe not as rare as we hope it is), but it does happen.

Then I got to thinking about how after 9/11 the government went bonkers with spying on everybody, spending billions of dollars to no good purpose, and never actually catching a single actual terrorist.  Is this another case like that?  Is there any actual evidence that fingerprinting everybody all the time genuinely works to prevent crimes?

158,209,1697377410.0,Why do people act like high interest rates on cars are such a big deal?,"First off, I'm gonna start off with the fact that interest on everything right now is ridiculous. It's entirely too high in general, and on something like a house, it could literally change your mortgage cost by more than $1000/month by paying a 7% interest rate vs 5%. So that's definitely notable.

But my question here is about cars specifically. Interest has a way smaller impact on a short-term purchase worth tens of thousands of dollars.

Just for fun, I configured a 2024 Honda CR-V and compared the monthly finance cost at different interest rates. With my configuration, the car came out to $36,175 on their website (I'm sure this would be higher at the actual point of sale because if dealer fees, etc., but that's beside the point). Right now, Honda has a promo where a 5 year loan is at 4.9% interest, which is decent. 

The monthly cost for a 5 year loan on a $36,175 car with 10% down (which are all pretty standard terms) is [$671/month at 4.9%](https://i.imgur.com/v5j2V7a.jpg). With 0 changes except bumping the interest rate to 7%, the monthly cost goes up to [$706/month](https://i.imgur.com/5Y7igM6.jpg).

At the monthly scale, that's a $35 difference. That increase is negligible in the grand scheme of things. Even by the end of the loan, you will have paid a grand total of $40,260 on the 4.9% rate vs $42,360 at 7%. Yeah that's an extra $2100, but again that's over the course of 5 years, so it's only $420/year.

I'm not saying this to get people to try to buy cars. Shit's expensive rn. Yall do what you want with your money. All I'm wondering is why an interest rate a few percent higher takes a car from ""affordable"" territory to ""not worth it"" for so many people when the total monthly cost difference is <$50 in a lot of cases",NoStupidQuestions

So I dont see the supposedly FRIENDSHIP with the Regular People of Korea and Japan In Social media where the Young people are now. Then does it really exxist?

The only times I see something Koreans and Japanese interact is When some Japanese is a Kpop artist and in one channel made by korea( youtube) there is one girl who has spent a lot time in korea and she can Speak korean they invite her. And barely any celbrities interactions except 

recent YOASOBI went to Korea and they had an interview with some Korean person.

That was nice. And in head in the Clouds 2023 festival some young Kpop people interacted with Japanese singers but it was like the first time they met a japanese person.

Can anyone explain How it works, even the youth still dont get along and Koreans don't like anything Japanese : entertainment or stuffs?  

One youtube channel said Korea is most have most Japanese restaurants and most visits to japan and Most buy cars from japan or something but then how come nothing is visible in social medias?

176,234,1697374407.0,"Most police departments nowadays have strict ""don't pursue"" policies which claim to result in fewer deaths/injuries of innocent bystanders. Has anyone researched if this effect holds up on a macro scale?","I've wondered this, since these policies started rolling out a decade or so ago. I feel like we should have enough data by now to answer this question.

There's no doubt that for an individual incident, the decision of police not to engage in a high speed pursuit lessens the danger to the public. But does it also encourage criminals to engage in riskier behavior, knowing that they have a lower chance of being caught? 

Say that enacting such policies have caused a 50% reduction in public risk on a per-incident basis; if criminals feel empowered to do more illegal things as a result, and deaths/injuries in aggregate are 2x higher...maybe we're actually better off going back to the old model.

I know you could argue this same thing for other things like some cities' decisions to stop prosecuting certain low-level crimes.

Of course as time passed I started seeing worse since I didn’t wear glasses or contacts or anything and here I am today having trouble seeing clearly even when I’m 1 meter away. I also have this issue where my eyes get really tired when I’m at college, I have to wipe them frequently through the day because they feel so uncomfortable and I also rarely get some tears in them. I was thinking of maybe going to the doctor and getting some contact lenses (I’m not wearing glasses no matter what) and perhaps in the summer I could look into surgery since I believe I’m too young to start struggling with contacts from now on for the rest of my life. I also sometimes get teary eyes when the wind is blowing hard in them so I’m afraid maybe they might be too sensitive for contacts? Or can anyone wear contacts? Are they less expensive than glasses? I know glasses are quite expensive and I don’t want to buy those just to wear them for 1 year + I hate the look. I’m also quite afraid of putting them in, I don’t want to scratch my eyes or anything like that. I also heard they can fall, does that happen often? And the most important and dumb question: I have a really good tolerance when it comes to screens. I play video games for 5 hours a day every single day and do not wish to stop or do anything that could minimize that time. If I get contacts I assume it should be better, right? My eyes would be more rested and it won’t negatively impact the time I can spend in front of a screen, either pc or phone, right?.. I just won’t bother doing anything about my eyes issues if there’s even a tiny chance I won’t be able to spend the same amount of time in front of screens anymore. I nap everyday because I do feel tired, but even when I don’t feel that tired I still nap to rest my eyes. Also how would the doctor appoinment go? I hate not knowing what’s going to happen. I hope they won’t be like „try different lenses and see when you see well enough” because I would have no idea what would be a good enough vision.

In the mode of production, individuals are actively engaged in activities such as cleaning dishes, playing games, musical instrument performances, or even walking. During this phase, we are essentially executing actions, relying on our existing knowledge or immediate environmental feedback to guide our actions. This mode appears to be the opposite of consuming information, as our primary focus is on output.  
  
Conversely, the mode of consumption pertains to activities involving the intake of information, which could include reading books, watching television series, listening to a speaker, or simply absorbing information from our surroundings. This mode revolves around information reception rather than active output.  
  
Remarkably, there exists a unique medium in which both these modes coexist harmoniously, and that is the act of having a conversation. Engaging in a conversation entails both the production of thoughts, words, and responses as well as the consumption of information through active listening and interpretation. The simultaneous utilization of both production and consumption modes in conversation results in a distinct and pleasurable experience.  
  
One fascinating observation I've made is that when I engage in the mode of production for several days in a row, I often experience exhaustion, and my mind naturally gravitates towards seeking a balance by shifting into the mode of consumption. Conversely, after extended periods of consuming information, I find myself inclined to engage in productive activities. This cyclical interplay between production and consumption is of particular interest to me.  
  
My question is whether there is any scientific basis or research in the fields of neurobiology and cognitive psychology that supports or contradicts this hypothesis. Can the brain truly be categorized into these two modes of production and consumption, and are there any known mechanisms or processes underlying this differentiation?

234,310,1697365295.0,How do I make a song stop having triggering effects?,"I went through a very traumatic breakup last year (we were together for 3 years) and they sent me a song that broke my heart so horribly i forced myself to go to therapy that same day. 

While it gave me horrible anxiety and hurt so much to listen to, I couldn’t stop for weeks on end, every day. (We broke up in August, ended up being my #1 listened to song on Spotify wrapped)

We ended up getting back together, and we’ve been dating again for a year (4 years total minus 3 weeks last year). Thing is, even still that I know it’s in the past and it’s all fixed, just hearing the first note of the song, or the title mentioned in casual conversation, I immediately feel the rush of all that despair and pain come back to me. 

This song can almost instantly cause a panic attack for me, and I hear it more often than I would like even when it’s just out and about on the radio or playing in stores. I had to be put on PTSD and anxiety medication just to deal with daily life from how hard this song broke me.

I want to get over this. I’ve tried exposure therapy, purposeful avoidance, mental preparation, everything my therapists and psychiatrists recommended me. It doesn’t do anything, and anytime it gets stuck in my head I feel so uneasy and physically sick to my stomach from the painful memories it brings back. 

I don’t know what to do. SO doesn’t connect music to memories like I do so they don’t fully understand or always remember that it is triggering to me to hear it (it’s still on their playlist, but to be fair it is a really good song musically).

240,318,1697364342.0,When is a good time to start dating?,"I'm 25M and this has been a huge gap in my life. I've always been deathly afraid and anxious at the thought of dating. In the seven years of my adult life I've been through ups and downs but it's mostly been downs. Recently though, I feel like things are actually getting better. I'm finally building resilience to setbacks and I'm actually feeling determined to get out of unhealthy patterns. I understand myself and my emotions better than ever.

I decided I'd try giving dating apps a shot a few months ago. Took me a while to build confidence to use them, but I'm getting matches now and it's providing me the promise of change in my life. But I'm extremely inexperienced in everything related to dating, all the way down to just making friends with someone. I even tend to hold back and withdraw when getting close to people, and probably the most important pattern I'm trying to break. My inexperience makes me feel like I'm not ready, meanwhile people my age are often starting to move on from experimenting and building up experience. 

I feel like I waited too long and should use the energy I have now towards making the best of the dwindling opportunities I have left. I know the right person won't care about inexperience, as long as we can hit it off. Me withdrawing doesn't make this easy though. So while I feel some rush, I also feel with every match I withdraw from or don't give my all, that I'm really just not ready for this yet. Still too much hurt and internal trouble. Need to learn how to make friends first, set appropriate boundaries, learn how to grow into my own identity after years of denying this to myself, hell, get a double bed and a decently-sized desk in a room away from my parents. I feel like people will expect at least some of these things from me and I feel so far behind the curve on them I can't reasonably let them get to know me without disclosing these.

I'm torn between just throwing myself in the deep, and waiting for a bit to get myself a little more together. How do you judge what's the right time, especially as I'm only getting older?

244,323,1697363915.0,Is permanent hair dye supposed to hurt?,"I’ve been dyeing my hair blue regularly for the past 6-7 years and wanted to switch to permanent instead to reduce how often I bleach my hair. So far so good, but the last time I used permanent dye— a couple months ago— it stung so bad that I was like rushing to get it out as fast as possible. For the record, it’s not like I’m sensitive to pain. I’ve gotten tattoos, piercings by hand and a couple surgeries so I’m no stranger to long periods of discomfort lol.

Yesterday, I got some more permanent dye and as I started my game plan, I decided to skip lightening. My hair is faded into a minty green at this point, but it’s still pretty light. Especially since my hair is usually medium to light brown. My roots still aren’t really visible either, so I can probably get away with it.

But is permanent dye supposed to do that? I see mixed responses and nearly all of them assume that the permanent dye is to go blonde or something. To my knowledge, permanent blue dye is still a new thing which just adds to complexity.  Some say the stinging is normal but others say it’s an allergic reaction. 

I do patch tests with this stuff and haven’t noticed anything of concern. And I don’t think it’s a chemical burn because when I rinse out the dye, the stinging immediately stops.

If it helps, I have fine but thick, medium to light brown hair. Im trying to be careful because last week, I was switched from testosterone injections to temporarily using testosterone gel. Gel is known to cause baldness faster than injections, and while both sides of the family have full heads of hair in their 60s and 70s, I still don’t want to gamble with it.

If it’s not supposed to sting, I’m going to bite the bullet and return to semi-permanent. I know people say to leave all this to a cosmetologist but I’ve tried ones in the county with mostly bad results. Whether it was damage to my skin/hair or just a bad dye job overall, I’ve had less bad experiences by myself than with people around here.


UPDATE: So I tried the dye again without using bleach, and so far there’s no pain. I think I need to space out the intervals for the bleach/dye part.",NoStupidQuestions

If there's something wrong with my post, please just tell me. Sorry if this is just something I should keep to myself, I just wanted to get other opinions on it because I'm nervous.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Context of my situation**  
\- I'm an adult living with 3 narcissistic and abusive people - 1 parent, 2 grandparents. My parent doesn't want me to be independent so I haven't been able to leave the house in months, with no signs of that changing. I haven't been able to get a ""real job"" as none of the many I applied to actually seem to be interesting in hiring people.

\- Recently the only stray cat I was close to was killed (by accident - I feel like I should also note it that it was a grandparent that killed it not me!) and I'm in desperate need of a companion, I just can't bare being here otherwise. There are other strays at the house but they don't come near me and I try to limit the time out of my room anyways.

\- This will be my first time adopting so I'm very new to the process. The application form I filled out had lots of personal questions like the birthdays and full names of people living in the home. After applying I got an email stating they would be doing a property check. At first I thought it just meant they were gonna look up the property on google maps, but after looking up info about adoptions I understand it means they'll be coming to the house.

I have several concerns + questions presented below.

  
***tldr: I'm an adult living with abusive hoarders, can't leave the house and unemployed. Cat died so I want a companion. Property check will be done. I have several concerns and questions.***

  
**I live with hoarders**  
There's lots of junk and food sitting outside and inside the house, key guest areas are mostly presentable but from you can definately tell there's a problem.

  
Will they be satisfied if I just direct them to my organized room where I plan on keeping the cat or will they want to check inside every room and around outside?

  
**I'm unemployed**  
I make money online but didn't mention it as it's not consistent and I didn't want questions about it.

Will they have a problem with me being unemployed? We have plenty of cat food and the person I mentioned in the application works constantly. I have saved enough money to purchase neccesities, and ubers + tip to and back from the humane society if need be.

  
**I don't have transportation**  
As mentioned before they don't like my leaving the house or being independent. I live in rural country so I can't just walk.  


I'm prepared to pay for an uber but I was wondering if it would be weird if I asked if they could deliver the cat to me? I would be willing to pay them for the trip + tip like I would pay uber.

  
**I don't have a traditional vet**  
There is someone that comes by and takes the cat to the vet for free whenever we have trouble. I didn't provide her number becuase I didn't know it, my parent is the one that communicates with her. I didn't want to ask her either because she always brushes me off and would've got upset at me for even daring to talk to her.

  
I am prepared to take my cat to the traditional vet if I need to, but I'd need to save up if it costs money to register with them or whatever you do. Honestly our current situation would work out in the case of an emergency, but I'm assuming that it's not sufficient enough.

  
**Made some mistakes on the form**  
\- I made some embarrassing mistakes on the form like leaving the roomates section blank because I wasn't thinking of them as roomates I had.  
\- I only mentioned my parent because I don't know the grandparent's full names or birthdays and due to reasons above I wasn't going to ask them.  
\- I mispelled the cat's name & used a different name entirely by accident.

  
Should I just consider myself fucked or is it possible it won't come up/ will be understandable mistakes? I wonder if I'm better of going to breeder but I can't afford it.

  
**Thank you for reading and I appreciate any advice, help or general support that's provided.**

339,435,1697336830.0,How to deal with overthinking?,"Throwaway account for reasons.

I'm a 37 year old guy. Never had a woman take interest in me. I met a wonderful lady last year. She has put in the effort to know me regardless of my looks, etc. She sees my negatives and my insecurities, and accepts them as part of me. I really like her and want to make this work to a point that I can spend my life with her. However, things have been difficult for the last 5 months or so. We don't live in the same city. She has told me she's not a phone person (whenever we've met, I've never seen her use her phone). I've spoken to her mother a few times and her mother has the same problem with her - that she doesn't use her phone as much so communication is difficult.

Recently, She's been busy and preoccupied with various things in her life. During our early days we would talk 3-4 times a week, mostly video calls. She would reply to my texts sometimes. But these days we barely talk at all and she doesn't respond to my texts either. We did get to talk a couple of weeks ago and she apologized a lot - told me she's sick and dealing with other things and she'll make things better soon. She even said she knows I'm worried about this situation and she isn't planning to leave me/ghost me.

All of this is causing me to overthink a lot.

I see one of two situations:
1. She's not really interested in me anymore (I did make my intentions pretty clear early on that I do want this to end up in a marriage or a similar commitment. We met on a dating site after all). She was just being nice to me and continues to be nice to me, but thats all it is. I should back off and accept this.
2. Given she's not a phone person, and given she has said she's dealing with a lot in life right now, I should just continue to give her space, be patient and be there for her. If I really want to marry her, I should treat her problems as my own, and right now the only thing I can do for her problems is give her the time and space to deal with them.

I genuinely like her a lot but I feel I'm reaching the end of my patience. I've been ghosted a lot in the past and this does seem similar. However given what I know of her, and given what she's said, I don't think she's ghosting.

I don’t think this cover is up anyway, but now I have more questions because what did come up was a slew of Saving Private Ryan results (and one Band of Brothers clip, which raises further questions.

Being able to find how good you can be in a field of your interest takes dedication into your career. Which means less attention will be placed in the social aspects of your life, and starting and maintaining a fruitful relationship with an SO may be less likely.

Working to Live:  
Finding any well paying career, travelling the world, creating beautiful relationships and experiences makes a life rich. You won't have to worry about not being satisfied living a life like that, however, for me that ""what if"" will be always in the back of my mind. Sure, you can let go of thoughts like those and just live in the present. But being a drifter in the world with no passion except for the passion they have for others, gives a sense of having no role in anything.

I don't remember the message but I remember that it was pretty much impossible to see normally but quite easy to read when the colors were inverted.

I tried replicating it without much luck. All I could find online is that this can't really be possible and yet I'm convinced I saw it. I'm assuming the hidden text would have been 1 pixel wide, and the background may not have been a flat color, so I'm thinking that something like a light beige and a yellow might look very similar normally but the darker colors when inverted would have made it easier to separate the two?

One pipe is held up by a nail. Is that normal? Am I overthinking this? 

I'm just worried I'm making a deal out of nothing. I don't know if it's normal for pipes to maybe leak a little out over time and the cabinets just soak up the stench?

Core courses in this major are intense, and while electives are chiller, even the lightest CS courseload can unexpectedly eat entire days’ worth of plans away to debugging unexpected bugs. Writing code is just cognitively intensive, and there’s a general expectation that students code a lot outside of class too, by practicing interview problems on a regular basis that resemble competition math more than anything actually done on the job, building up projects for portfolios, doing internships every summer they can, etc. I see my peers applying to many hundreds of places and getting ghosted or rejected from all and claiming that that’s normal, and going through gruelling multi-round interview processes for internships and fresh grad jobs. I haven’t even been interview prepping like my peers and my major has been a strain on my relationships that no part of high school ever was. The other majors I see this stressed out are in Engineering and in Architecture. I can’t really fathom where the idea that this is as good as it gets comes from.

464,598,1697335936.0,Do you think society dismissed Christianity to make people weak?,"No stupid questions so here goes, i’ve been thinking about this recently. I’ve always been an atheist(?) but I do think that most religions (that i’m aware of, I am not well versed in every religion) are probably all based around things that may have happened and stories of people that may have existed and done good/ bad things although I have struggled to see the “God” side of things. 
I know there have always been issues and horrific things throughout human history no matter of religions existence but I think that I was influenced growing up to dismiss Christianity even at school I was taught about it but there was never a drive or push towards any belief which i know they can’t do at school because it’s about education and not opinion (well it’s meant to be although it doesn’t seem that way anymore) 
I feel like since Christianity became less popular that our standards of how we act as people has seriously declined. Was it the case that older people were scared of doing bad things because of God? I’m not saying that religion makes you perfect and as I already said i don’t consider myself religious at all but have our standards fallen since we dropped mainstream Western Christianity? 
And the headline question, do you think this could be a bigger thing because the only things that seem to have ever brought people together no matter your background have been money and religion. 
I watched kingdom of heaven (a movie about the crusades) and upon further research the fact that a thousand years ago so many countries were brought together to fight side by side by Christianity alone is impressive and nothing like that has ever happened since? Money is only available to few who can pay people to support them but religion is basically free to everybody and could bring people together as it has in history.
Do you think that it’s a wanted thing to dissolve mass belief in the Western world to get rid of another thing that could bond people in numbers that are concerning to the powers that be?

Probably worded that horrendously but i’ve been trying to talk to my pals about it but they don’t really have opinions except for saying “religion is a joke, people who believe a magic man made everything are stupid” It’s not relevant if any of it is true imo when i see religious people having higher standards of the way people should be.

 the players enter some ruins and they all roll perception. Some of the players roll high enough to hear something that the other players don't hear. I could play the audio, speak, or whatever, and only the players who are supposed to hear it will hear it. Nobody knows what was needed to be rolled in order to hear this, therefore, none of players knows that another player heard something that they didn't, likewise, the players who did hear something wouldn't know the other players didn't hear it.

547,704,1697328330.0,Is it possible that a teenager deployed an EMP on my home security system for the sole purpose of ding dong ditching my house?,"I know that sounds absurd but here’s what happened. This afternoon at 3:09 PM, my doorbell rang. Soon after, I saw a teenager absolutely booking it away from my house. Playing ding dong ditch. No big deal, we were all kids once.

As it happens though, I recently had a camera installed by my front door, which allows playback within the past 24 hours. On a whim, and mostly in the interest of testing out my new camera system, I decide to pull up the video of the kid ringing my doorbell. Here’s where it gets weird though.

I know for a FACT the time it happened. I also know the camera’s clock is set correctly. But I watched the entirety of 3:09, and there’s nothing. No one comes up to ring the bell. I check 3:08 and 3:10, on the off chance the clock is slightly off, but of course it’s not, and I find nothing. That’s when I notice something.

At precisely 3:09:13, the camera feed freezes. The clock stops, everything stops moving. A short while later at 3:09:25, it resumes and plays normally. The only possibility is that this kid ding dong ditched my house during this 12 second window. Given how fast they did it, it’s entirely possible that they were able to get in, ding dong, and subsequently ditch within this narrow time frame.

Which begs the question. Is this just the biggest coincidence ever (my cameras have never done anything of the sort before), or was the camera failure a deliberate stealth tactic by whom I can only assume is the teenage version of Jason Bourne? How is that even possible?",NoStupidQuestions

Nice guy, taught me to do the hoop and stick game. And when I was a kid the future seemed interesting. Not nice, necessarily, we were definitely expecting some sort of holocaust, but interesting! For the purposes of this rant I’ll focus on sports. 

I used to love the DC comic Strange Sports Stories. Whether it was playing hockey against a vengeful ghost, tennis with a live grenade or pole vaulting through time, it was awesome. I also loved the game parts of Rollerball, in the way only a bloodthirsty kid who doesn’t care about social commentary can. And who didn’t enjoy watching the Harlem Globetrotters finally figure out how to beat those pesky robots?

I’m not saying that’s what i expected the future of sports to look like, but i thought new sports would be exciting at least. Instead we’ve got the dystopia future where corporations and billionaires are running everything into the ground, but instead of futuristic sports they’ve apparently decided to replace horseshoes with cornhole and something called ladderball, as if children flinging rusty hunks of iron at each other is a bad thing.  And we’ve got the wealth inequality and environmental destruction of Rollerball but Pamela Hensley is nowhere to be found and i can’t sit in a packed arena chanting “Jonathan! Jonathan!”

What prompted this post was the renovations my town has been doing to a park near my house. I thought they might be putting in a court for tennis or maybe basketball, but apparently they decided to put in two pickleball courts. And apparently it’s the fastest growing sport in America?

So there’s my question - when and why did the future of sports veer away from Rollerball and towards Wiffle-Tennis?

And another question while I’m here - why is it called Pickleball? Does it even involve vinegar?",NoStupidQuestions

In order to captain a boat, or fly a plane, or join the military and fight/die, you have to go through some form of testing and training before you are considered capable enough to operate (and we still screw up).  Yet, perhaps the most important creative or destructive thing we can do as human beings is create more life, and there is no formal training or requirements before you can reproduce.  We’re all just kind of winging it.

You are too reserved and quiet. Look at colleague X, she’s doing well (also a new joiner)”. I find the comments and feedback dismissive and unhelpful, borderline hurtful.

572,741,1697325871.0,Why am I getting the same amount of action as a rock?,"So let me try to wrap this up as quickly as I can. I feel like its important to give as many details as possible to get the best advice possible so this may be a bit of a challenge but anyways…

Im a guy in my mid 20s. Back in high school I was a sex machine. I got head a lot and had sex at a very early age. Super early bloomer. Anyways, post high school everything changed. I never got a girlfriend again, and at best all I ever got was talking stages with women. Not for lack of trying. Since highschool I have tried with all my might to have any sort of girlfriend, and it has just never worked out. Friend zoning, ghosting, all of it has happened to me. All of it except for it working out.

I’m not ugly. I’ve been called attractive a lot. I have great hair, a nice smile. I’m not rich. I’m poor. But I know that rarely matters, just again giving more detail. I don’t live with my parents. I am really creative and have made some impressive creative achievements. I like to consider myself as empathetic and motivated. I constantly spend hours daily thinking on how to better myself. I work out. What I’m trying to say is I think I’d fit the idea of a catch to some people. 

Despite all of this, I am invisible to women. Dating apps don’t work for me. Going to clubs with my friends doesn’t work either. My friends (who I will add are on the same level of good looking as me if not below; I know thats a scummy thing to say but I’m just trying to paint a picture of my confusion. They’re great people. I am shorter than all of them. I’m a short guy. But I’ve seen guys shorter than me get laid.) will get all the attention while I’m approaching women only for them to walk away when I do or act like I’m an annoyance on their day. Which fine yeah they don’t owe me anything but what is driving me crazy is just that I don’t get why thats what happens. I like to find solutions to problems. I like to improve. And yet I can never fix this issue in my life. 

I will add I am mentally ill. I have been hospitalized before unfortunately. I go to therapy. I suffer from some diagnosed illnesses. Nothing reality distorting. Just depression adhd etc.

I hear all kinds of things from friends. “You overthink too much” or “you have to work on your self esteem” or whatever. That’s cool man but I try to adapt myself everytime I hear these things. Try to fix them. I listen to advice. I try to do different things. I try to fix my problems. None of it has helped.

So what is it? What is my issue? When will this nightmare end? Sometimes I joke that the universe has this rule where it has forbidden me to find a hook-up or a relationship or marriage or whatever. Maybe as karma or a joke. I don’t know. Nothing else makes sense. I can’t find an answer. I just feel like I’d save myself so much mental pain if I accepted being single as my fate. Its like having this hope that theres an answer out there is what causes the pain. If I just stopped hoping and accepted defeat then I’d stop being let down or caring. I want to stop. But my friends don’t let me. They say one day it will happen. That I’m such a doomer or pessimist. But I don’t see it that way. All evidence points to the contrary. Years of rejection. It won’t stop. I don’t get it. It gets to the point with my friends where I feel like they just keep telling me to keep going because it makes them laugh to see me continue to try. Like a running joke.

1. Can I still use the contact I got out of my eye, or should I throw it out? It was one of those monthly ones, and not at the end of its use.

587,760,1697324298.0,Catching bosses right hand drinking at work,"Second hand story - Me and the witnessing party (Joe) have complete opposite beliefs on what should take place.

Joe has been working there for about a year. Is friendly with people around them but is not nearly as well acquainted with the boss.

Right hand (John) was not explicitly caught drinking but a strong smell of spirits was smelt as they were walking by, being the only other person in the office - as well as being every now and then quite difficult to understand, leads to believe they might be drinking at work. John exhibits on and off slurred speech and is difficult to understand, some days he speaks perfectly fine. Joe is not a native english speaker and was quicker to blame themselves for poor understanding.

*What should happen now*

I believe something like this should be reported to the Boss. Not in any malicious way, no harm has been done and it is safe to assume that this is not having an impact on John's work.
I look at this situation from the point of view of the Boss. I would like to know information like this, no matter how likely it is to be true. I would also gain respect for Joe, of course if they were to handle this tastefully.

Joe believes that this is sticking your nose into someone's else's business. They are not friendly with the boss, they find it unlikely that the Boss would not know of something like this, they work closely together and if it was a big issue it would have been known by now.

I would also like to clear up that i can't paint the full picture of how uncomfortable a situation like this would be for Joe and so I can't name any other tangible reasons to support Joe's side because there are a lot of unspoken emotions at play.

Ok so I have thought problems where I wanted to text or say something to a loved one or anybody or even ask a question and it’s like my mind gets stuck on constantly thinking that I shouldn’t say that or text that at that time or whatever. I’m currently 2 days sober off smoking delta 8 thc but I use to smoke heavy amounts of weed and mix it with alchemical substances like gold and platinum l(God juices). Is this thought problems where the mind gets stuck from doing or saying something for no reason? I studied up on fluorescent light and find that it’s bad for your mental health and am just now wearing my fluorescent light blocking glasses. Blue light from digital screens is also not good. I would smoke weed and just stare at digital screen thinking about what I want to do or what’s concerning me and now it’s worse. Could this be the cause of the problem?",NoStupidQuestions

Men are initially attracted to me then fade away as I’ve started being more upfront and it’s cost me being loved.

I let men know I’m a homebody who’s not in the hookup culture and they fade away.

At first, they think I’m fun but realize how boring I really am once I let them know upfront due to me not wanting to lead anyone on and waste time nor manipulate them into more then disappoint them.

Im really sad as I’m deeply afraid that I’ll never find a man who’s into a homebody woman who doesn’t hookup as I’ve been single for half a decade and only getting older.

All my friends hookup and they have men eating out the palm of their hands and desperate to commit to them and marry them.

Things I want but only if it’s the right person and I’m sure of it.

They have no worry like me as they get extremely good guys and only the players ask me *and* my friends out which is extremely depressing as I feel why am I so unworthy but to attract unfaithful men and my friends loyal, faithful men who dote on them adoringly in droves????

648,840,1697317784.0,why am i the only one that's stupid,"Maybe this could be seen as a rant but it's both tbh.

I started going to driving school for B category last week. It was absolute hell. I am stuck on couple things that i don't understand and no matter how much i re-read all we wrote i still can't understand it properly nor remember it. I also get headaches a lot it's literally only when I'm there. We usually are there for like 2h 35min or like 3h 30min. 

I feel so fucking stupid. I'm the only girl there, there's like 5-6 of us. I feel like I'm the only one who understands nothing. When we practice answering questions i always stay silent when answers are revealed because i realize how many mistakes i actually make and its mostly the ones others got correct. Last time i didn't even bother reading nor understanding much i hated it and felt so low. Few times the instructor (also a woman) said like ""this is harder for us girls"" or ""especially girls need to be careful"" it's like i don't care but it's humiliating why am i the only one that has to be especially careful when driving behind trucks or going around cars? 

Also when they talk about like car brands and types idk i just don't understand anything and everyone else does like i can tell you what color it is or if it's passat or citroen but that's it. Add some numbers or letters or other words? Goodbye. It's so embarrassing. 

I don't know why it's taking such a toll on me tbh it's not that deep but it is and I'm paying money for it i don't want to fail and lose it all but it's so hard i hate it. 

I genuinely don't know what to do or how to get better. I'm definitely not gonna tell if I'm wrong because I'm introverted and shy so hell no but I'm at a loss. 

What am i supposed to do? I literally have only 1 day to learn what we did in 6. Ig my best way of learning is basically re-writing everything we wrote till now but idk if i should write in a new notebook where i understand it better (i used one where i wrote it all shitty cus it was just for the beginning but i had not time to re-write) or should i after every lesson write it on my computer and print it out? Maybe i will have easier access and it'll be easier to read? Or to just use a notebook? How to even practice all this properly? I'm really sorry i hope this is right sub reddit for this i don't know where else to post it.

653,845,1697317600.0,Can I report an employer having us put in fake lunch breaks and urging employees to turn in timesheets with hours before working (and then making them work over those hours) in the state of California?,"What the title says. I work once a week for a public university's law school and work 6+ hours.

As far as I'm aware, in the state of California we have the right to a 10 minute rest break and a 30 minute lunch break. My employer does not offer us a lunch break and has us work straight through, they then ask us to falsify our timesheets by adding in an hour lunch break and putting in an extra hour of work to make up for that hour of pay.

They also ask us to turn in our timesheets before we work and often ask us to log the hours 7-12..  our program always goes til 1 or later, however the official hours are to 12. They ask us to change our timesheets after the fact which is a long process (I'm assuming to delay payday)... I don't do this, I just wait and log my time after work is over.

It's a teaching job with highschoolers. They allow us to work before we have had the livescan (fingerprint scan/background check and confirmation of eligibility to work in the US) which I also believe is illegal.

We also had an incident last year with one of our co-workers talking inappropriately with a highschooler. They did nothing about the situation. It happened again and they lied multiple times saying they did something, changing the story to ""we didn't know"", ""we did something just no one told you"", ""we didn't do something the first time but the second time we did"". In the end, they asked us to no longer report these incidents as we should ""trust our boss""...

Over the course of the last week I have very quickly lost all my motivation. I don't wanna get out of bed for anything. Nothing sounds good to me anymore. All the hobbies I was addicted to seem pointless. I used to LOVE my job now I'm about to resign because it seems stupid and I don't want to leave the house.   


All I feel like I can do is lay on the floor/bed and cry. But I'm crying without a reason, it feels so strange.

And I can't really remember anything that's happening. Like yesterday feels like a dream.

Can depression just come on suddenly like that? And without a reason? (If yeah, what should I do? I can't afford therapy or anything like that, have crap insurance.)

Or if you are angry and crying people immediately dismiss you because of the tears. I don’t even feel that hurt by it, I don’t care, but my body still cries. I work in a high stress medical job, and I CANNOT be crying when I have to talk to patients. It doesn’t even matter if it’s a sad topic like death, I will cry anyway at ANY emotion. I’m assuming it is because I have hyperhydrosis (my sweat glands are very active. Like, if I am emotional I will need to change my shirt within the hour active. I assume that it effects my tear production too) This needs to stop.

689,887,1697314581.0,Conflicted about removing a tattoo,"So I got a tattoo at a point in my life where I was trying something new in a new relationship. The whole memory of getting the tattoo is really special to me (stick n poke in a punk rock trailer in the desert in the rain with new sweet friends and a budding love story - with someone who ended up treating me as bad as it gets without killing me, but I still endear the beginning stages of that adventure). It’s a symbol of survival and also how I claimed my own power when I entered that time, and also when I walked away. However, no one in my family or friends likes it. I honestly feel insecure about it. If it were surrounded by other tattoos I wouldn’t, but it’s all by itself on my arm. Also, it’s not the arm I wish it were on. The dislike for the tattoo is palpable from my family. I know how it sounds to say all this and that many folks would tell me that it’s my body and to keep it if I like it, but my truest friends feel sad when they see it, albeit confused (and that’s ok). I hope I see the artist again because we’re friends now although in different places, and I worry how she would feel, or rather, how I feel about removing it. The artist did a good job and she did what I asked her to. I just don’t like where I chose to have the tattoo nor it’s expression (a possum with its mouth open - I thought it would b fierce but it just reminds me of pain). Emotionally, I’m attached to it when I’m by myself and I gaze at it. In public sometimes I get self conscious of it, however. Has anyone else experienced similar feelings regarding a tattoo? What did you do? I’ve done two rounds of laser removal so far and I booked my appointment for the third. I don’t want to sell out my integrity, but I also feel that it affects the way I carry myself around others, so that’s affecting my integrity in an other way. I’m a violinist and training as a sound healer, so it might be in my best interest to have nothing on my arms. So, if you’re reading this, do I sound more like I’m wanting to keep it or remove it? Because it’s hard for me to tell. Thank you!!! If anyone has similar stories I’d love to hear.",NoStupidQuestions

694,895,1697313548.0,Why do some body washes lather more easily than others?,"TL;DR: I bought a different type of body wash than usual when my local store was out of stock, and this other type doesn't spread/lather as well for me. What ingredient(s) should I shop for in the future that's in the 'good' wash or avoid that's in the 'bad' wash?


I usually use Dove ""Cucumber and Green Tea"" body wash, but when it was out of stock at my store the other month I had to substitute with Dove ""Sensitive Skin hypoallergenic"". The cucumber one clings to my skin long enough in the shower for me to squirt with one hand and then lather on my skin with the other hand (I don't use a loofah or washcloth, though maybe I should. that's outside the scope of this question tho). Or long enough to start lathering, realize I forgot to brace my leg on the edge of the tub, move my leg up, and then continue lathering.

But the sensitive skin one sometimes slides right off my body in that split second right after I've squirted it?? So I've had to start carefully cupping each squirt and start lathering it in the palm of my hand immediately, otherwise the glob of it often drop onto the tub floor and go to waste. It also tends more toward staying in the original squirts/globs and needs more force for me to work it into my skin when I *do* catch runaways in time.


I'm assuming one of the culprit ingredients is gonna be well-known-ish, but when I Google for the differences intra-body-wash all I get are results about the differences between bar soap and body wash 🤦‍♂️. I would maybe guess glycerine, but that's present in both formulations. So maybe soybean oil?? The non-overlapping ingredients are:

Cucumber (easy to lather):

- sodium methyl lauroyl taurate
- sodium benzoate
- hydrogenated vegetable glycerides
- glyceryl stearate
- glycol distearate
- hydroxystearic acid
- cucumis sativus (cucumber) juice
- camellia sinensis leaf extract
- carrageenan
- cyamopsis tetragonoloba (guar) gum
- sodium gluconate
- alpha-isomethyl ionone
- hexyl cinnamal
- limonene
- linalool

Sensitive (harder to lather):

- sodium hydroxypropyl starch phosphate
- sodium lauroyl glycinate
- hydrogenated soybean oil
- glycine soja (soybean) oil
- guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride
- bht
- tetrasodium edta

We know that some individuals can only receive LASIK or PRK once in their lifetime, while others may be eligible for multiple surgeries. 

So, why isn't the surgery performed on the 15-year-old to potentially reduce their prescription back to 0? Then, when they're 19, it might not be as high as 5, possibly a 3 or less.

744,956,1697309278.0,How does a movie critic fairly critique children's movies for rating purposes?,"I'm high, this is probably simple but it occurred to me that a lot of older children's movies that ""flopped"" flopped mostly because of our parents, not so much the quality of the film and that seems to weigh in a lot on what remakes are made. Everyone has their own opinion on remakes, this isn't that debate, but there are animated films that are widely and wildly requested to be remade (even in live action) but because the original film ""flopped"" it's not a priority, if it's on the radar at all. My mental rabbit whole dug itself deeper when I realized that an entire industry is compromised of basically 40+ aged men and is trying to direct you to what they think is what. We've had this weird trend of a bunch of old men complaining that the avengers aren't the godfather, animation isn't ""cinema"" kind of thing and I feel like it's going to negatively influence today's cult classics going forward. 

My anecdotal example is going to be Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001). It's a huge fan favorite, and it had less than stellar reception on release and is considered a ""flop"". Despite some pretty vocal support, it doesn't appear to be on anyone's radar at all in terms of remakes or continuation. It came out next to Fellowship of the Ring, Jurassic park 3, and Planet of the Apes on the same year that the towers fell. Of course a children's movie is going to perform poorly, but that shouldn't be what's reflective of its modern viability.

How do critics who are so far dissociated from children they may as well be alien give movies made for children a fair shake? What ways could we today make sure that the deserving ""underperformers"" of our time don't end up covered in dust in the next 20-30 years?",NoStupidQuestions

747,959,1697309140.0,How can someone escape the US?,"I know this will probably make a lot of people angry because America is of course not the worst place in the world, but I also feel like I am extremely unhappy here and don't have a lot of prospects. If this seems like a bit of a long-winded question, I apologize. I'm just exhausted with the constant upstream struggle.

Career wise, I have little hope of staying in the same field. I work as a deputy coroner, have a master's degree in forensic medicine, and am working on a doctorate in forensic science, which are extremely niche credentials that only really apply within the American medicolegal death investigation or crime scene work, which I'm sure are different elsewhere. Despite having a very interesting day job, I barely make enough to survive even extremely frugally. Inflation has made my $60k/yr position feel like a $30k job, which is where I was for most of my adult life despite ""succeeding"" in school (which everybody told me was a ticket to success). Full tuition academic undergrad scholarship, 4.0GPA from high school to grad school, all the bullshit effort that goes into trying to ""follow your heart"" and make a career, and today I had to make a trip to the pawn shop and the plasma center just to make it to payday.

I don't know how someone gets out of this. I don't know whether it's the country or the whole world. I just want to get off the low part of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and I don't know how. In my escapist mind I envision moving somewhere else with better healthcare, a lower cost of living, where people actually give a shit about each other instead of just chasing a dollar so they can get a bigger truck so they can get more dollars so they can get a bigger truck.

And even if a place like that exists - somewhere I can thrive even on a single room with a cot - I can't imagine they'd want some random American with skills only in an extremely niche and underpaid field. We're the laughing stock of the rest of the world.

How do I get off this treadmill? Is there any country that would be a viable option to start fresh? I'm now middle aged and hopeless and maybe I should just embrace the suck until I die.

748,961,1697308915.0,What does my ex want from me as she keeps coming back to me?,"For context I (19F) struggle with borderline personality disorder. I know all my posts are so dramatic but. My ex (/FP) and I had been broken up for 3 months and while I rejected friendship for my sake, she tried so hard continuously to be my friend. I enforced boundaries over and over. Just because throughout our relationship I was entirely obsessed with her and stressed so much over her. I had spent a month abroad with her just crying continuously because I felt like she was drifting.

Now she is back in my life and we’ve hooked up twice and she seems to want it to be a regular thing. I enjoy it definitely but everything feels so weird ): and I don’t know how to cope. Last year we were so close and we were each other’s only friends (freshman year of college) and this year I have a singular occasional friend while she has a big friend group and so much going on for her. 

Everything is so different and its freaking me out. She comes over and is obviously interested in seeing me but at the same time makes jokes about this not being a relationship, and we’re just casual etc. I don’t want a relationship right now either but I want to understand what exactly she wants from me and why she keeps popping back into my life, insistently. I don’t want her out of my life, there’s definitely lost trust and affection for her but after a year together I do feel some attachment. 

Someone please help me understand what she wants. She has friends, she has a big group, and I was moving on. I rejected friendship, which seemed to be all she wanted, now 2-3 weeks later she is hooking up with me, cuddling in my bed, sleeping over, and talking about future meetups.

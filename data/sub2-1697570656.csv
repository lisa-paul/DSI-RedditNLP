7,1697570364.0,I'm about to share my biggest secret with this girl...please talk me out of it,"Hey guys, I need some advice, mostly ladies, but the guys can still contribute. 

I've been friends with this lady since 2018. I liked her a lot, so did she. She gave me all the green lights possible, saying I'm the perfect type of guy physically, asking multiple times why I've not asked her out, I'll just give the generic excuse that its not about her, its me.
I'm sure you'd be wondering what I was waiting for. Well, I do have a Small dick, and she was usually vocal about liking big dicks, talking about wanting to 'feel full'. Even going as far as mocking guys with Small dicks, wondering how they manage to survive with the 'shame'.

So our friendship has been fine since then, though she was clearly getting frustrated as she refused to hang out several times during subsequent years. She moved to a different city in 2021, and we've barely communicated on phone since.

Anyways, I travelled to her City recently, and guess who i ran into. The meeting was pleasant enough, until I mistakenly suggested to catch up. She begrudgingly accepted, even stating she may not have the chance, and I hope thats the case.

This sounds like something that shouldn't really be an issue, so why am I worried about catching up with a friend of 5 years? Well, I do kind of feel like I've not been fair to her. Women rarely show their intentions that overtly, plus I didn't meet her by chance, I actually cold approached her, so obviously, her confusion is understandable. Our relationship has deteriorated over the years, and I do kind of miss her. Outside of hating Small dicks, she's a nice person to be around. 

If I have the chance meet up with her before leaving,  I'm thinking of opening up to her, and telling her the reason why I've never tried to ask her out. 

I feel like this is a terrible idea, so please talk me out of it...OR NOT?",NoStupidQuestions

And my personal take is that if you don't want to be friends with someone that has a baby, (especially when you're still teenagers), that should not be frowned upon.  Obviously there are right and wrong ways to go about ending a friendship in any context, but I just think that if you are that young, and your peers are having kids and you are just not comfortable to have to start hanging out with that friend and their child, you shouldn't have to.

66,1697566527.0,Why am I (23M) struggling to accept my gfs (23F) past?,"I’d like some opinions on my situation.

I’m not religious, nor do I think I necessarily have conservative values - yet I’m bothered by my partners low number of previous sexual partners (4) despite it being the same as my own. I’ve had intrusive thoughts and obsess over details, which made me think it’s OCD/retroactive jealousy - but when those thoughts subside I’m left with an underlying “feeling” and think about the number of past partners my girlfriend has had. I don’t necessarily feel disgusted, or fearful of anything - I just don’t like it, and it sits in my mind mostly all day every day. 

I know I love my partner, I know I see a future with her, and if any of my friends came to me about this issue I’d tell them 4 previous partners is next to nothing and to not worry about it. But why do I feel differently? Why do I hold myself to different standards as I hold my partner? To me, having 4 previous partners is nothing - I was made fun of at uni for not having enough “fun” and for having a poor dating life haha. 

If this is a deeply ingrained misogynistic trait from my own mind, can I change this with time? I’m aware that my thoughts are unfair and hypocritical, and I’m aware they’re preventing me from being fully happy. I don’t want to be in a relationship where I’m always low key holding something against my partner, but I feel this thought process will follow me to new relationships - and I don’t necessarily want a virgin partner. 

I want to change my thought process and become more accepting, and stop holding double standards. But is this truly possible? Or am I stuck like this forever? Because if I am, I’m going to live a very sad, lonely life.

We understand adoption can bring forth many different types of kids, all ages and such. But in general has anyone both adopted and had a child and found that one came with way more financial surprises than the other, or about the same? We are okay financially but want to provide children with more than enough love, time, and care. To do that, we’d like to be as financially prepared as possible, and maybe make a choice that allows us to provide the child with the best quality of life.

Here relationships go beyond what's normal in developed countries where most people have relatives in parents, siblings or no siblings and grandparents only.

I was gonna give it to goodwill but it’d be nice to give it directly to someone who needs it

The thing is, I don’t actually know if they’re homeless or not. Their signs usually say something along the lines of “family fell on hard times, need money for food, god bless,“ etc. I’m afraid of offending them by assuming their daughter might be cold at night.

My husband had an organ transplant. If you weren't aware, you need to take certain medications to prevent your immune system from attacking the new organ. Now Medicare was paying for the medication up to three years after transplant, which ran out this summer. So we had to use our private insurance, which wouldn't cover it because they prefer a different brand. My husband can't take their preferred brand because the side effects interfered with his quality of life. So we appealed and they agreed to cover it.

Well, the doctors changed his dose. So we were waiting for the insurance company to approve it, the doctors to give prior authorization (whatever that is) and for the pharmacy to get the ok. For. A. Month. Thankfully we had a backup supply that he could use but that ran out over the weekend. Two days worth of phone calls led to us learning we had to appeal it to the insurance company again because even though it's the same medication it was a different dose.

182,1697558252.0,Is there water you can’t float/swim in? (A question about water treatment plants).,"I really want to pose this question to askscience, but I don’t think they’ll take it. Part of the problem is that I have but a vague idea what I’m trying to ask. Here goes : A few years ago, my kids’ Boy Scout troop took what felt like a pretty clandestine trip to a water sanitation plant, (I think). Truly, I have no recollection of exactly what they did at this place, (I knew at the time, I just can’t remember).

 “Bob,” our tour guide, who pretty much agreed to let 40  little kids walk around the place on a whim, took us into this large two story building that we entered into on the second floor. There was a cat walk that spanned the length of the room, and that’s what we stood on. 20 or more feet below us was the water. The room was dark, very stinky, and that water was black and still. So here we are on this catwalk with all our kids and, like, the absolute bare minimum for railing, and Bob says, “if anyone fell in this water they’d sink straight to the bottom because it has no oxygen.” 

 There, that’s the whole reason for this post, I promptly scooted my kids out of there while other kids climbed all over that railing for a better look. This has always bothered me, because it seems so dangerous and I don’t know why Bob or anyone else would think that letting 40 ten and under children run along that cat walk was a good idea. 

 Last night it occurred to me that maybe Bob was actually full of poop and had no idea what he was talking about, that would make me feel better. Like, knowing that if a child had fallen into that water an adult could have rescued them would make me feel better. (I should say here that it did not appear to me that there was some other safeguard in place, but maybe someone who is familiar with water treatment plants knows that there would have been). 

 So, is there water that a human body would be unable to float or swim in, and is it likely that the water at this treatment plant was in that category? Was this as dangerous as I felt it was?",NoStupidQuestions

301,1697546298.0,My ex(27m) wants to sue me(30f),"He moved out last September. We had a daughter who was a stillborn and it completely destroyed me, him and our relationship. It got ugly, he moved out my house. He  Left his bed, couches, dressers, lots of clothes and shoes, hats etc.
Over the year we stayed in touch and would have times where we would try to work on things, have sex, go out etc. 
It turned ugly because I found out he was on dating sites while telling me we are working on things, also he'd like womens Instagram pics which is one of my pet peeves. Just alot of disrespectful shit. Anyways so we'd set up days for him to get his belongings maybe like a bag here and there, we'd always end up having sex talking etc and ""trying again"". 
But this time I moved on and he doesn't want the relationship either. 
But now he wants to sue me for money I owe him? I don't owe him money. The only thing may be that the puppy (we got together**) destroyed his couch. The dressers and bed, those items have been in my house for a year. He never made real effort to get them. Now he wants them a year later and wants to sue me. I told him he can have the dressers but the bed is staying because I've slept in it alone for a year and he bought a new bed anyways so him wanting a bed that isn't even in great condition (cause of the puppy, he left me to raise alone!) .

It disgusts me he wants to sue me because my parents actually bought him a car while we were together, my family did more for him in a year than his whole family has done for him, he lived in MY home for a year I did his laundry, cooked, cleaned, we had a great relationship while i was pregnant. He did pay half my mortage which helped  but thats expected of since he lived in MY house.
I'm just disgusted by him that he may actually sue. Idk if he's bluffing or what. 
I believe the rules in PA are he abanded his items and never got them within 30 days.
He never made attempts within the 30 days after moving out to get bed or dressers. A year ago. 
He's maybe mentioned throughout the year but our schedules wouldn't work out, he didn't have help, no storage unit yet, etc etc always excuses. And then sometimes we'd fight and I would say no I don't want you anywhere near my house but this was said 6 months after his bed and dressers were left without him living with me.

Do you think it's possible he actually has a chance to win this fight?

now, i love him because he’s my dad and all, but him locking the basement away from my sister and i worries me. i have no clue what would be down there that he doesn’t want us to see. last i knew, it was just christmas decorations. i plan on asking him if i can ever bring it up naturally in a conversation with him.

I always wanted to start a beverage company that make drinks for kids. The beverages are 100% juice with fruit jelly inside them. I do not have too much start up cost so all the beverage packing companies are not in the scope of my budget. I am going to rent a commercial kitchen to produce these myself manually.   


Here are the key points:  
The containers are PET plastic cans.   
I plan on heating up the beverages to around 170 Fahrenheit, and then put my premade jelly inside.   
The containers are all sterilized in hot water before being filled.  
I will seal these cans right away using a can seamer.

494,1697521731.0,"Is it stupid to expect true love, and leave if I don’t find it?","I’ve been a little bit (translation: extremely and debilitatingly) lonely recently and well, I’ve been fairly confused about how I should act / what I should expect when dating. I’ve always been fairly emotionally sensitive/fragile, and I don’t think it’s healthy for me to date people if I don’t get the quantity of love I feel I need.  I’m very scared of the possibility of love dying out over time, and I really have become almost depressed at the thought that I will never find a person that will reciprocate as much love as I want to give.  

I feel like dating someone whom you have ceased to be in love with is unfair to you and to the person you’re dating, but I’m also scared if I spend my life searching for the perfect person I’ll run out of time and end up alone.  I know fairytale love is rare, but anything less seems almost depressing.  I have a need to love and be loved, not just passively, but I feel I need to be IN love. I fear that that need will forever be unfulfilled, and it’s taking a huge toll on my mental health.  So much so that I’m often finding myself crying at night, and having to distract myself from thinking about it, because the moment I do start thinking of it I just can’t stop.  

So, if I’m in a relationship and the fire goes out, is it reasonable for me to leave, even if we still love eachother?  When I hear people talk about their relationships, it’s almost always depressing.  Of course there’s the occasional one that gives me hope, like [this](https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/s4OnlapYgQ) one,  but is it reasonable to search for that type of love, even if it means giving up relationships that many people would stay in for the rest of their lives? 

I’ve made the mistake of scrolling Reddit for a few years and I’m sure the sheer number of depressing stories on here have affected my judgement of relationships, but normal love just doesn’t seem like it’s enough for me.  I feel like if the love fizzles out, I’d become completely overwhelmed by the fear of missing out on the possibility of “true love” that I would become a bad partner, and I don’t think it’s fair to stay in a relationship if that relationship will never fill your desires, the whole idea of “settling” seems so wrong to me, if you’re “settling” that means that there’s something better out there, and you’ve essentially just given up, and that is not something I would ever want to do. 

And what happens when the love does fizzle out? Especially if you’re married the way people talk about it seems like they just accept it and never go back to being in love again.  I don’t know if I could handle falling out of love with someone I thought would be the one I loved forever.

So, here’s what I want (need) and feel like is unattainable.

-a relationship where the honeymoon phase never ends (or at least where you stay in-love like the post I mentioned [(this one)](https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/s4OnlapYgQ)

-a partner that needs and wants me as much as I need them

-a partner I feel secure with, and who always has my back

-someone I can look at and no matter how bad I’ve been feeling know that my life matters so much more because of them, and that I would give anything for them.

I know people will say I am putting too much emphasis on this part of my life, but I can’t help it, it’s the purest desire I’ve ever felt, it’s unwavering, unquenchable, and all devouring.  Everything I do now, is depressing because I realize I could be doing it with someone I love. It’s like a switch suddenly flipped and I realized I’ve been seeing in black and white my whole life, but the only way to see color is to go through a lifetime of heartbreak and pain, uncertainty and anguish, just for a chance to feel the love I so desperately need to feel.  So, what the fuck do I do?  And to those who have these mythical relationships where your love doesn’t fade, how do you keep that? And to those whose love has fizzled out, what changed from the honeymoon phase that made you and your partner drift apart?

Apologies for the long post, this is sort of half because I want answers, and half because I feel like writing out my feelings helps a bit.  Also, as you probably guessed, I’m fairly young (early 20’s) and sort of trying to understand my fears and feelings.",NoStupidQuestions

Today, she came to class wearing a band tee that’s mine and I didn’t know she still had. I acted surprised and told her I wanna wear it this weekend to a concert I’m going to. No response from her except a laugh. 

Normally at the end of class she would walk over to me smiling and make chit chat. This time, when class ended, she put on her headphones and walked away fast. Then whenever I walked past her on campus again she was ignoring me — didn’t make eye contact at all. Find it weird for someone who spent the whole day yesterday cuddling and watching movies with me. And kissing me even more than she did by the end of our relationship. 

She had told me on Wednesday that she would only reach out to me once and then that if I wanted to see her again, the ball was in my court. Yet she was the one to ask if she could come over again twice. And then last night I think she wanted to smoke with me and I told her we could hang later in the week. I asked her when she’s free and she said she would let me know. “Okiee ill lyk”. I didn’t see reason to text back.

I have this artwork which occurred naturally, and I feel as though some type of rich collector might find it appealing enough to pay a lot of money.

I mean, it's uncanny how picture-perfect this artwork is.

It's simply a rough cut panel/board/plank of wood. The woodgrain, for some strange reason, created an unimaginable looking copy of some sort of shark.

I worked at a lumber mill awhile back, I watched thousands of boards of wood pass by me on a conveyor belt every week. I'd see all kinds of woodgrain-images which vaguely resembled faces/objects.

One day, a board of wood came down the line and I just so happen to notice this work of art. I asked a nearby saw operator to roughly cut the image out of the board, kind of like a plaque that you'd hang on a wall. 

I now own this thing, this completely natural image of a shark. The board of wood is about 9 inches long, 1 inch deep, 4 inches wide. 
The woodgrain shark took on a dark green appearance, it even appears to have varying degrees of ""shading."" As if it were painted on by an artist. 
It's unmistakably a shark, a very detailed shark.

I've gotten to a point where I am nodding off and having trouble keeping my eyes open but I've never nodded off to the point of unconsciousness. If I let myself go with the nodding off I will eventually fall asleep, but I have never gone from awake to, BAM, dead to the world. Rather, I just slowly drift off.

620,1697510878.0,Is it better to call someone out or just leave in silence?,"Specifically, I've been dealing with a now former coworker who, I don't know what her true motive is anymore. She's a married woman with 3 kids.

At first, I thought she just needed someone to talk to. But I guess this became an emotional affair because of how she'd compare me to her husband. She invited me over, ""off the books"", and while her husband and kids weren't home for what I now assume was a physical affair. But I'm assuming the husband showed up cause she abruptly cancelled last second.

Since then, she became obsessive. Texting me all the time. Getting upset if I didn't text back (but it's okay if she doesn't), listening to her issues or even coming to talk to her. She even texted me, ""were you here and didn't come say hi to me?"". She's even physically chased after me on more than one occasion.

Now that she doesn't work with me anymore, she finds some excuse to text me or call me every 3 months. It's been her car breaking down, asking stupid questions about the Internet or even something marvel movie related. But she won't answer me after a while and it's annoying.

I know the easy answer is the block her. But I still physically see her because she's still involved in a way at work and we see each other at sports games.

Part of me really wants to just completely call her out. Like when she calls answer saying it's her backup husband speaking or something. But I know the passive route may be easier but she always loses her shit if I go radio silent on her.

I have some common sense so im not going to just yell out ""hey guys look at me im depressed"" or so on, but if I get into a conversation and I feel as if I can comfortably speak on a sensitive topic with this person-- I will. Whether I've known them for a few minutes or a few years. Of course I won't speak on things that I may still have shame from or embarrassing stuff that if it were to ""be used against me"" I wouldn't really care.
But when I was doing this, the other party was fine but my mother got annoyed and angry that I would go to these people about it.
Now I was very confused from her reaction so I went to a friend for a little help and they said ""maybe she just doesn't want you to tell everyone your business,""
which if it had anything to do with her I wouldn't have said anything since it's not my story to speak on...But this was MY story and I was telling it to people who's been vulnerable with me and genuinely gave me good advice.
So I guess, that being said is it wrong to be open? I feel like I don't struggle with social ques and I know there's a time and a place so... Idk Im just a little confused.

in case anyone asks for specific information. 
tw; SA?
but what happened was I was 
Basically groped by a co-worker. It made me feel very gross and uncomfortable. 
I went to my mother (who works with me) and well we didn't really talk about it. She's just the type to not want to dwell on stuff like that while I need to release how I feel to other's or in general.
Well I still struggled with believing it wasn't my fault it happened so I came to these 2 older women coworkers of mine that are very open and accepting. I told them what happened and I was told to report to HR...which unfortunately I will not be doing.
They spoke to me about ways to protect myself etc and overall how to not be a naive 19yo girl 😮‍💨
but my mother took it as me claiming she didn't care because I should have came to her first about it (i did)
and then it just blew up.
I know I'm young and naive so im still learning, my judgment may not always be right ever... But my mother threw it in my face and essentially blamed me for what happened and accused me of acting too grown and giving my trust too easily.

I'm trying to get a state identification card, while being unable to visit a BMV near me (Ohio).

I've had my drivers license for 10 years but I didn't make the deadline to renew before it expired. I'm severely agoraphobic nowadays and I'm unable to leave my house. The covid lockdowns created such anxiety and stress in my life, and being unable to do anything or leave - just left me homebound. Overtime it developed into a major condition.

However, as I'm unable to leave my house, and the closest BMV is 25 minutes away - which is completely outside of my comfort zone; I'm just unable to go there. The issue arises when I can't get any online doctors to assist me because they can't verify my identity. I can't seem to do anything anymore without some sort of identity. I can't start an online business because I can't verify my identity to accept payments, I can't manage crypto because of the same reason. I can't do anything without getting a state ID card.

Is there a way, or an organization that's able to help people in my situation?

I'm at a complete loss of words at how bad things have gotten, and you can't do anything without verifying yourself anymore.

they want an x-ray to confirm. im scared that they'll put me on another 6 month, ""Just In Case,"" antibiotic regimen to cover their ass. i dont think the xray showed anything bad before (i dont even remember an xray being requested 10 years ago). the antibiotics has nasty side effects that are advertised at long-term use, and it was done once already without additional exposure to TB risk areas. sure, an immigration doctor covering their bases will make you take it. but... being in the US for 10+ years..no way there's TB. its not like there was any treatment beyond the long term meds.

I'm back in the U.S. now, and I have a job I originally loved, but it's starting to kind of suck. I'd read some less-than-flattering things about the boss on company-review sites, knew it could be true, but took this job anyway. It's good money, I need the health insurance, and it's work I know how to do fairly well, which always brings with it some degree of satisfaction.

But recently, the boss has become ...let's just say....how they were described in company reviews online. I'm seeing how everyone, myself included, is stressed, stretched way beyond their capacity, and working to meet unrealistic goals set by the boss. Plus, we're all having tasks handed to us that are not in line with our actual position because there's no one else to do these tasks.

I told my boss I'm at capacity last week, and they nodded with faux-sympathy and added another massive task to my roster (urgent, of course), a task that another employee, stretched way beyond capacity, has no room to handle.

I'm even being messaged by my boss on weekends, though I don't answer.

I had read online that my company culture is terrible and that the stress of this place will be unmanageable, and I'm a cynic who always assumed companies suck ass by default, but this is wild. Everyone walks (or types, as we're remote) on eggshells around this person. It's completely wild. I feel like I'm in a TV show.

But for the last year or so, I’ve just had this intense longing to be pregnant and have a baby. So much that it makes my heart hurt when I realize I can’t have one for a good few years. It’s not like anything really triggered it either. I’ve been on the same birth control for years and I haven’t started any new hormonal medication or anything, I don’t know anyone who’s had a baby within the last year or anything else that would have brought this baby fever on. I’ve always wanted kids and been able to daydream about it here and there, but it’s never been so intense! I dream about it at least a few times a week and it feels like my heart breaks into a million pieces when I wake up and realize it was just a dream. So is there a reason for this? Is it going to go away? Or am I going to be stuck like this for the next ten years until I pop one out?",NoStupidQuestions

why do people make jokes about getting the runs or being chained to a toilet after eating certain food so much?

like Mexican food, fast food, etc. 

This has only happened to me once in my documentable life. I went to a diner while traveling 3 days in a row, and the food was mad greasy, so it did give me uh.. somewhat loose stools. But other than this? I’ve always just pooped like normal. The times when I do have looser stools (diarrhea is such an ugly word. I can’t bring myself to say it), it’s always due to either illness or menses. Never diet. 

I know that if your stomach isn’t used to the grease, it can affect you. But I grew up barely eating fast food since my mom was a stickler over it, and yet I still have never had my waste affected when I consume fast food.

757,1697501803.0,How is it LESS expensive to have health insurance?

Obviously I do not have the most income at my disposal, so I am looking at the low-premium high-deductable plans available to someone like me. 

What I don’t understand is this- I am a healthy young man who will maybe see a primary care physician once a year, which upon googling, will cost me anywhere from $100-$200 per visit. That’s lower than ALL of the monthly premiums I am seeing. And then a specialist visit could be $300-$500, but if I still haven’t reached my deductible, that means I have to pay that out of pocket, which is kind of like I don’t have insurance at all, no? If my deductible is $7,000, that means I have to see 14 specialists per year at $500 per visit before the insurance company even starts doing what I am paying into it for. That’s absurd! And I don’t even get vision or dental on this plan, so I ask, what even is the point?

“I’m thankful for school and everybody who is here in this circle, we’re still waiting on Aunty M so I hope she gets here soon and safely and I love you all 😊”and so on.

It got to my uncle and he broke down crying, my first time I ever seen him cry. All the adults were consoling him and hugging him and I was confused what was happening. Then I overhear that he and my Aunty M are getting a divorce and my heart and jaw dropped to the floor…I had no idea and I just spent a whole 2 minutes rambling on about her being here all the while my uncle is crying 🤦🏽‍♀️

Is this normal?,"I'm in my early 20s, so I'm supposed to be in my sexual prime. But I can't help but feel like sex is a chore. People my age go on and on about how great sex is, some even do stupid things or put themselves in risky situations just to have sex, but I often just sit there not really understanding what all the hullabaloo is about. I wasn't raised in a religious household, but sex was never talked about, almost taboo. Unlike most people in high school, I graduated high school having never has sex, let alone kissing anyone. So I wonder if that has anything to do with it? Maybe not really being allowed to have sex or explore intimacy as a teenager like most people do killed something in me unconsciously. I remember even after my first time, which was when I was 18 after graduating high school, the guy that I was with I was really attracted to physically and emotionally. We had sex and then I thought to myself, ""Is that it? Is that all there is?"" But I remember when I was in high school I almost had a constant hard-on. Maybe never having those desires fulfilled as a boy turned me off under the surface, but I'm unaware of it 

I've been told to try different toys, different kinds of lube, different positions, to change it up, and I have done all that.

I'm gay and I once had a guy who didn't douche beforehand and when I penetrated him after awhile I realized there was poop on my penis. That was two years ago, so I'm over it, but I sometimes do think about that. I've had sexual partners comment on how I often seem confused or disinterested or stare into space or look bored when having sex. It's odd because even with someone I find hot it's never really been fulfilling in the end. Even when I was 18 and I was new to sex, I found that I sometimes wouldn't even get erect.

833,1697496905.0,How common are Happy Ending Massages really?,"For context, I’m a young woman who just moved to a major US city. Lots of strip malls advertise these cheap and quick massage parlors behind curtained windows with generic names like “Sun Spa” etc. I’ve had two friends who have anecdotally visited spas that included some kind of “happy ending” that they weren’t expecting.

I’m in the market for a cheap massage, but I’m seriously hoping to avoid that kind of “mix-up” altogether. This has literally stopped me from going to get one, as I become doubly convinced that the price is reflecting the additional services and not the quality of the massage itself - and that even if I do bite the bullet and say “no thank you,” it’s probably not gonna be the best massage because that’s just not the spa’s focus.

For context I’ve only gotten massages in sports therapy settings and once or twice at a hotel spa.
I’m at the point where I’m convinced that every cheap walk-in place is gonna mean I have to clarify that it’s not a sexual thing. God forbid I say something before and they’re literally a wholesome family-run spa. But also, god forbid somebody touches my butthole before I can say “no thanks.”

Which is great, right? The only issue is...I fucking hate texting. As much as possible, I just banter for a bit and then like to schedule more dates. I'd rather meet someone in person than talk to a screen.

But of course, they are the ones more dedicated to their faith than I am, so I like to think their opinions trumps over mine.

1:When the question arose,it first showed itself on paper relatively quickly in the convo,so while they could have thought it was ""dividing in half"" instead of dividing by half, the equation already showed 300/0.5 on paper,as well as the 300/2 to clear up that possible misconception.

914,1697491403.0,What is this technique called when arrguing?,"For example, when I still lived with my mum; I had a sleep disorder. Some days I'd wake up at 2am, other days I'd wake up at 5pm.I had a routine for a few days, it would get disturbed, throw me into a new routine that would last 4-7 days. So I had a different sleep pattern every week. 

I'd come down and my mum would ask me something like ""Have you just woke up?"" I've had this conversation enough times to know it's not a real question. She already had the answer in her head and is just waiting for me to give that answer so we can have an argument over it. So instead of answering her, I call her out on it. Tell her she already knows what the answer is and every time we have this conversation it devolves into an argument, so why even ask the question. It replaces the initial anger she felt with embarrassment because she went in with an expectation of how the conversation was going to turn out and I flipped it into calling her out on her behaviour.

So the technique is recognising patterns in somebodies behaviour and using that to deduce what their motivation is and then instead of having the conversation go the way they planned you've used that information to flip the topic back onto them and now you're talking about their behaviour instead of your own.

972,1697487110.0,Choking someone,"Strange title I know. I’ve always wondered what’s the difference between someone choking someone unconscious, like in an MMA fight for example. The victim then being fine after a few minutes VS choking someone to death like say in films? I don’t understand it all really. Is it about the length of time? Does X amount of time being choked make you unconscious but X amount of time kills you? Or is it about the force? Or technique?

Like I’ve seen Jon Jones for example choke one of his fans (by their request) unconscious, they’re absolutely fine within minutes. But then you see it on films (I know films aren’t always based on real life) and the person is dead. 

Genuinely confused and would love anyone’s insight. Thanks in advance.",NoStupidQuestions

976,1697486792.0,"I want to find a shampoo with ""no synthetic fragrance"" but Google and Bing and Amazon all keep showing me ""fragrance free"" shampoos instead. How can I do this search?","I remember maybe 10 years ago I could use double quotes to search for an exact phrase but now it seems like I can't do that anymore.

I am looking for shampoo that has no synthetic fragrance.  I do want shampoo with fragrance - just not *synthetic* fragrance.  I want a shampoo that is scented with only essential oils or plant extracts. 

On a shampoo label, this would look like the exact phrase ""no synthetic fragrance."" I have never seen it worded any other way on a product label.  But occasionally they might add a little more detail like ""no synthetic fragrance- scented only with essential oils and plant extracts."" That extra detail is not on the label most of the time.

This is my search term:

""no synthetic fragrance"" shampoo

And the search results keep showing me ""fragrance-free"" shampoos, which is not what I want.

Amazon and Bing and Google all had the same behavior.

Can someone give me a ""How to search for an exact phrase in 2023"" tutorial? Thanks in advance.

I'm open to shampoo brand suggestions too if the search is impossible.",NoStupidQuestions

### Executive Summary
- Project Question: 
	- Can computer data modelling predict which of two subreddits a post "is in"?
- Project Answer:
	- Not better than people, yet.


### Description

For project 3, the goal was two-fold:
1. Using [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), to collect posts from two subreddits of my choosing.
2. then use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from.

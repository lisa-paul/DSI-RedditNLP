[Sean Hulseman] 12:24:58
One thing about my 2 data sets, which is a lot of fun, is when you actually look at the comments, it's a lot of complaining about traffic.

[Sean Hulseman] 12:25:06
In these 2 cities because that seems to be what most people care about in Boston and Chicago is how bad the traffic is and how bad public transportation is.

[Sean Hulseman] 12:25:14
There really complain about their own public transportation systems.

[Muhammad] 12:25:24
Chicago is very bad. I guys talk like 4 h on the highway one time.

[Sean Hulseman] 12:25:34
Yeah, I can see that. That's terrible. Driving at rush hour from like 3 till not 8, 7 or 8 is rush hour.

[Muhammad] 12:25:41
Yeah.

[Nolan Smurro] 12:47:47
You know, quiet, you must be getting all the work done.

[Susan] 12:47:53
Spending 10 min figuring out that the reason it's not working is because I failed to capitalize a letter.

[Susan] 12:47:59
Yeah, good times.

[Nolan Smurro] 12:48:04
I'd say you'll never make that mistake again, but I'd probably be lying. Okay.

[Susan] 12:48:07
Yes, probably do it today.

[Mike M] 12:48:12
I'm procrastinating by looking at more data science.

[Nolan Smurro] 12:48:18
That has educational value.

[Lisa] 12:48:20
I'm procrastinating too. I'm kinda freaking out. Yeah. Yeah.

[Susan] 12:48:26
Breathe and ask questions.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:55:27
How's anyone been having any issues when you use like a vectorizer creating a data frame that is just memory like consumes too much memory.

[justondea] 12:55:38
Not yet, I haven't.

[justondea] 12:55:45
Is there like an error message going? For years?

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:55:48
Yeah, there's a few so it's saying unable to allocate 1.9 GB for an array with shape 9,000 and it gives me the shape.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:55:56
And my issue is that so I tried to leave it as a sparse array, but then I can't convert it to a data frame if I do that.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:56:02
So I'm trying to figure out how to. Cause I'm not gonna save down any of these large data firms, but I just wondering if there's like something else I should be doing.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:56:12
I don't know. Or if I should just not do what I'm doing.

[Nolan Smurro] 12:56:20
Do you have the same problem if you try trimming your data set down to like a smaller size?

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:56:28
I haven't wanted to, but I probably should just do that. I mean, it's probably not super.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:56:34
Important because this is I'm probably not gonna use the status that anyway this is the one that has like there's I have a second data set where I cut all the posts.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:56:44
That aren't a minimum length. Which is probably what I'm gonna use anyway, but I did want to look at and see if there is any models that use the shorter posts.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:56:52
But.

[Mike M] 12:56:56
Hey, did you say that the, the sparse? Matrix was taking up almost 2 gigs.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:57:02
It wasn't, it's not letting me save it as a sparse matrix. So when I was using it, when I'm using to dense to save it as a data frame.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:57:10
Then it's taking up almost 2 gigs, but I don't know how when I try to save it as a sparse matrix, then it doesn't have the right.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:57:17
Dimensions and so it's not like me save it that way so I'm not sure if maybe I'm just Miss typing something?

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:57:25
But like when I share how to save like for instance, the XDF equals PD dot data frame X columns equals C back get feature names out then I end up Then it doesn't have the right like the dimensions between x and the columns don't match.

[Mike M] 12:57:42
Yeah.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:57:43
So that's why kind of forcing me to create it. In like when I was going back through the notes, whenever we created a data frame, we always did it as we identified it so that way it would be the right shape.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:57:55
But it's not even letting me do that because it's too big. So.

[Mike M] 12:58:01
I'm just about to try this myself. I'm a little bit worried about how much like how big these things are gonna be.

[Sean Hulseman] 12:58:06
How many subs are you working with?

[Sean Hulseman] 12:58:10
Or post, sorry.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:58:11
So this one is one that has 9,000 posts or not or sorry, 9,400. Though not all of them are that.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:58:19
Large and then it would have created 27,000 problems.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:58:27
I have another one just to give you guys an idea of what wasn't too big.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:58:34
The one that was, let's see.

[Mike M] 12:58:51
Only thing I can think of is maybe like, I don't know, this may not be the.

[Mike M] 12:58:58
Like way you wanna go about it, but I'm curious if it would work. What if you tried doing it with like, diagrams or trigrams and just brought the number of columns down.

[Mike M] 12:59:08
Actually, I don't even know if that would bring it down because all the unique combinations.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:59:12
I could do that and then I'd be so that's one thing I want to grid search over as well is whether to add biograms and trigrams.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:59:20
If you set the minimum n grand to be 2 or 3, then Oh no, you're right.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:59:25
I think it would still increase the size though. Because even if you because then because it's going to try every single column and it's going to repeat words.

[Mike M] 12:59:35
Yeah, because let's see.

[Mike M] 12:59:39
Well, it might reduce the number of features, right? Cause if you have 3 unique words, you get, and if you did biograms, you'd get 2, right? You get one and 2 and you get 2 and 3.

[Mike M] 12:59:49
So you go from 3 I'm just curious if it would just let you get past that step and we could just write it off as like a memory thing.

[Katie Ellsweig] 12:59:55
Yeah, but then if you have a sentence of 10 you go from having 10 unique features to

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:00:04
You know, like that'll increase, like, cause all this is one.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:00:10
That would only work at the coast are all short. Then it would only decrease. But if you have 10 words of the sentence, you're gonna end up with more than 10.

[Mike M] 13:00:20
Hmm. Yes, do you have stop words in there?

[Nolan Smurro] 13:05:54
What did you learn, Katie?

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:06:01
So one need to clean up my RAM and 2 also need to probably add some more things like for instance, So I just don't end up with 27,000 columns.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:06:11
And like max features as well, probably.

[Nolan Smurro] 13:06:16
What's that cut out if you're using if you specify

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:06:20
So MDF is the, minimum data frequency. So if award only appears in one post.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:06:26
It won't, so let's say I set them DF to be 2, then I'm looking for words that appear at least twice.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:06:31
Or in in 2 different posts. And so I can set that up to whatever like I might even play around with that but.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:06:38
That are probably cut out at least some of the 27,000 columns.

[Susan] 13:06:43
Because they're not gonna help you predict anything. Anyway. Because they're only showing up once so you can't use them for anything really.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:06:47
Exactly. Yeah, unless there's 10,000 words that appear once that it. That only appear in one and then another 10,000 appear once and only appear on the other but that would be very silly.

[Susan] 13:07:03
I'm gonna go with that's not how language works.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:07:07
No.

[Nolan Smurro] 13:07:10
This is Reddit we're dealing with though so anything on the same.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:07:14
Within my also within my subreddits, which are highly related. It's very unlikely that there's a word that.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:07:21
Will only appear once and be definitive. Actually, there's probably a few.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:07:37
My biggest concern too is as I'm building these models like just ending up with something that is just not at all predictive because my subreddits are related.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:07:48
We're so related.

[Susan] 13:07:50
Okay.

[Sean Hulseman] 13:07:50
Yeah, I'm at like 80% right now with my model. Just. Predicting one sub riot versus the other when it's 50 50 balance.

[Sean Hulseman] 13:07:59
I don't know if that's good. Probably not.

[Susan] 13:08:01
I'm gonna go with Katie. You're the amount of data that you have is gonna help you immensely.

[Susan] 13:08:09
And I think you'll be fine.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:08:11
Thank you.

[Susan] 13:08:21
I have a, sorry, music.

[Susan] 13:08:26
I have about 3,000 posts in both of my subreddits. And I was kind of going for stuff that I thought would be somewhat similar.

[Susan] 13:08:38
So it'd be like a bit of a challenge, but I don't know that it is.

[Susan] 13:08:42
And I'm getting like, 96. Percent accuracy.

[Nolan Smurro] 13:08:49
That's really good.

[Susan] 13:08:49
So. Alright, maybe I pick stuff that has that like less in common than I thought. I picked, I thought.

[Mike M] 13:08:50
And that's nice.

[Lisa] 13:08:50
Yeah, nice.

[Susan] 13:08:58
Here is my logic and you're gonna see it on my, presentation slides, but I picked camping.

[Susan] 13:09:04
And digital nomads? Thinking that there is like there is a conjunction there which is van dwellers.

[Susan] 13:09:13
But I don't know that I don't know, but anyhow.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:09:16
Susan, I also paint camping. I paid camping and ultra light.

[Susan] 13:09:20
Oh, okay. Well, so theoretically they're different. Right? Camping's in the middle.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:09:22
Okay. Yes. No, that's actually really funny. Also, has anybody ever encountered a pickling error?

[Susan] 13:09:35
No, but that's the most fun name so far.

[Mike M] 13:09:35
And you said, that is funny.

[Lisa] 13:09:38
What the hell?

[Lisa] 13:09:46
Oh my god, I'm dying.

[Mike M] 13:09:52
You have to, you have to, that in your presentation, that's amazing.

[Susan] 13:09:56
Yeah, absolutely do with a picture of a pickle.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:10:01
So somehow my snipping tool broke, so I have to figure out how to fix that so I can and and recreate this our message once I do.

[Lisa] 13:10:10
I took a screenshot, so just a moment.

[Nolan Smurro] 13:10:22
You don't need snipping tool, got friends with snipping tool.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:10:26
Well, I can take a full screenshot. It just if I wanna only take a screenshot of the.

[Lisa] 13:10:31
Yeah, no fair.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:12:41
So if anyone ever gets that error message, you're probably just trying to do too much and you do less and it works.

[Susan] 13:12:58
Katie, you were earning your overachiever tag again.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:13:02
Not even overachieving this is literally just trying to run a model. And I just, I, what I did was I took out, I actually still had an MDF, one of them, like one was an option.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:13:14
So I took one out. This is actually, this is separate. So the data, the data set I was working with was smaller here.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:13:20
So I didn't really pay as much attention in MDF equals 1 2 3 4 so I took one out and now it's running.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:13:26
But it's probably to take a long time to run anyway.

[Mike M] 13:13:32
You get a 404 pickle not fast.

[Katie Ellsweig] 13:13:42
So I think in this case pickle is actually

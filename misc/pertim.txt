For project 3, where we have multiple data pulls and need to check for / remove duplicate reddit posts, does that have to be within the python code?

Yes, it's data manipulation so it needs to be written in python. You weren't going to use Excel were you :eyes:

Haha, no, unix commands. It would be a one-liner, or just a few clear ones. I would save them to a script if that helped.

Iâ€™ll keep it in Python!



memo to self, it would involve comm (and cat >> bigfile.csv)
but therefore probably awk or whatever to make sure I know where the separator is (multi-line posts) before using 'comm'

includes the awk to get the columns?

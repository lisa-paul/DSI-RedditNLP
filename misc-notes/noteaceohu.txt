regarding counting / finding a binarized column or whatever

wine = pd.read_csv("data/winequality_merged.csv")
print(wine.red_wine.value_counts(normalize=True))
wine.head()


shows only those w/ col of red_wine as "1"
which I may well be doing w/ my which_sub thingy

pd.DataFrame(gs.cv_results_)






df = pd.DataFrame(gs.cv_results_)
plt.plot(df.param_C, df.mean_test_score)
